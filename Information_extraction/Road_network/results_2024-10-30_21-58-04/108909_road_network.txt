### Step 1 - Extract the Number of Ways and Lanes from Crash Sketch & Summary

1. **Identify Main and Branch Road Features**:
   - From the sketch:
     - V2 is driving on the **main road** (westbound lanes of the freeway).
     - V1 is on the **branch road** (entrance ramp), attempting to merge into the main road.

2. **Analyze V2’s Road Features in the Crash Summary**:
   - The crash summary describes V2’s road as:
     > "Vehicle two (V2), a 2000 Peterbilt tractor pulling one trailer was traveling west in the right westbound lane of a six-lane, divided, limited-access freeway (three lanes westbound, protected median, three lanes eastbound)."
   - Based on this, we determine that the main road is a **six-lane, divided road**:
     - **No_ways_main_road** = 2 (one way for westbound, one way for eastbound)
     - **No_lanes_main_road** = 6 (three lanes westbound, three lanes eastbound)

3. **Analyze V1’s Road Features in the Crash Summary**:
   - The crash summary for V1 states:
     > "Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 1998 Jeep Cherokee Sport, 2-door utility vehicle was traveling on a one-way entrance ramp and was attempting to enter the right westbound lane."
   - The sketch shows a single lane on the entrance ramp, so:
     - **No_lanes_branch_road** = 1

### Step 2 - Approximate the Length of the Main Road and Lane Width from the Sketch

1. **Calculate Main Road Length**:
   - In the sketch, the main road spans horizontally from the leftmost to the rightmost ends.
   - With a truck (V2) length of 20 meters, we estimate the main road length as approximately 6 truck lengths:
     - **Length_main_road** = 20 x 6 = 120 meters

2. **Estimate Lane Width**:
   - The truck (V2) is centered in a lane, with about half a truck width on each side.
   - Calculation: `2.5 + (2.5/2) + (2.5/2) = 5` meters
     - **Width** = 5 meters

### Step 3 - Validation
Our answers are:
{'No_ways_main_road': 2, 'No_lanes_main_road': 6, 'No_lanes_branch_road': 1, 'Length_main': 120, 'Width': 5}

Validation:
1. **No_ways_main_road** and **No_lanes_main_road**: Matches the summary’s description of a "six-lane divided, limited-access freeway."
2. **No_lanes_branch_road**: The sketch shows a single lane on the entrance ramp, consistent with the summary.
3. **Length_main**: 120 meters, consistent with 6 truck lengths (20 meters each) in the sketch.
4. **Width**: 5 meters, consistent with lane positioning based on truck width in the sketch.

Since all values align with the dataset, the validation result is **Passed**.

### Final Output
{'No_ways_main_road': 2, 'No_lanes_main_road': 6, 'No_lanes_branch_road': 1, 'Length_main': 120, 'Width': 5, 'Validation': 'Passed'}
