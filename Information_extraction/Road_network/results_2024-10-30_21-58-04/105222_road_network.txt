### Analysis Process

#### Step 1 - Extract the Number of Ways and Lanes
1. **Read the crash summary** to identify the number of ways and lanes:
   - Example sentence: "Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee, 4-door utility vehicle was traveling north in the left northbound lane of a four-lane, two-way urban roadway (two lanes northbound, two lanes southbound)."
2. **Identify Key Descriptors**:
   - "Two-way" describes the **number of ways** (answer: 2).
   - "Four-lane" describes the **number of lanes** (answer: 4).

#### Step 2 - Estimate Road Length and Lane Width from the Sketch
1. **Road Length**:
   - The sketch shows a straight road with multiple vehicles.
   - Measure the road's length using car body lengths as a reference (e.g., 10 car lengths).
   - Calculation: \(5 \, \text{meters} \times 10 = 50 \, \text{meters}\).
   
2. **Lane Width**:
   - The car (marked "V1") occupies the middle of a lane.
   - Estimate lane width as the car’s width (2 meters) plus half-car-width space on each side.
   - Calculation: \(2 + \frac{2}{2} + \frac{2}{2} = 4 \, \text{meters}\).

#### Step 3 - Validation
Verify the extracted values with the dataset:
- **No_ways** = 2: Matches the "two-way roadway" description in the summary.
- **No_lanes** = 4: Matches the "four-lane" description in the summary.
- **Length** = 50 meters: Consistent with 10 car lengths, as observed in the sketch.
- **Width** = 4 meters: Consistent with the car’s width and spacing within the lane.

Since all values align with the data, the validation is **Passed**.

### Final Output
```python
{'No_ways': 2, 'No_lanes': 4, 'Length': 50, 'Width': 4, 'Validation': 'Passed'}
