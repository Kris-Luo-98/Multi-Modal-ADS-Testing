### Step 1 - Extract the Number of Ways and Lanes from Crash Sketch & Summary

1. **Identify Main and Branch Road Features**:
   - From the sketch:
     - V1 is driving on the **branch road** (entrance ramp).
     - V2 is on the **main road** (freeway).

2. **Analyze V1’s Road Features in the Crash Summary**:
   - The crash summary describes V1’s road as:
     > "Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2002 Honda Accord, 4-door sedan was traveling in a northeasterly direction on a one-lane, one-way freeway entrance ramp to a limited access freeway."
   - Based on this, we determine that the branch road is a **one-lane, one-way entrance ramp**:
     - **No_lanes_branch_road** = 1

3. **Analyze V2’s Road Features in the Crash Summary**:
   - The crash summary describes V2’s road as:
     > "Vehicle two (V2), a 2006 Freightliner tractor pulling one trailer was traveling east in the right eastbound lane of a five-lane limited access freeway (two lanes westbound, center divider, two through lanes eastbound and one merging entrance ramp on the eastbound side)."
   - Based on this, we determine that the main road is a **five-lane divided freeway**:
     - **No_ways_main_road** = 2 (eastbound and westbound)
     - **No_lanes_main_road** = 5 (2 eastbound, 2 westbound, and 1 merging lane)

### Step 2 - Approximate the Length of the Main Road and Lane Width from the Sketch

1. **Calculate Main Road Length**:
   - In the sketch, the main road spans horizontally from the leftmost to the rightmost ends.
   - With a truck length of 20 meters, we estimate the main road length as approximately 6 truck lengths:
     - **Length_main_road** = 20 x 6 = 120 meters

2. **Estimate Lane Width**:
   - The truck (V2) is centered in a lane, and the width of the truck is 2.5 meters.
   - The lane width is typically slightly larger than the vehicle width, so we estimate the lane width to be around 3.5 meters:
     - **Width** = 3.5 meters

### Step 3 - Validation
Our answers are:
{'No_ways_main_road': 2, 'No_lanes_main_road': 5, 'No_lanes_branch_road': 1, 'Length_main': 120, 'Width': 3.5}

Validation:
1. **No_ways_main_road** and **No_lanes_main_road**: Matches the summary’s description of a "five-lane limited access freeway (two lanes westbound, center divider, two through lanes eastbound and one merging entrance ramp)."
2. **No_lanes_branch_road**: The summary clearly states that the entrance ramp is a "one-lane, one-way" road.
3. **Length_main**: 120 meters, consistent with 6 truck lengths (20 meters each) in the sketch.
4. **Width**: 3.5 meters, consistent with the truck width and typical lane dimensions.

Since all values align with the dataset, the validation result is **Passed**.

### Final Output
{'No_ways_main_road': 2, 'No_lanes_main_road': 5, 'No_lanes_branch_road': 1, 'Length_main': 120, 'Width': 3.5, 'Validation': 'Passed'}
