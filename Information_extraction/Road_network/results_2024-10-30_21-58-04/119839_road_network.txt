### Step 1 - Extract the Number of Ways and Lanes from Crash Sketch & Summary

1. **Identify Road Features for V1 (Main Road)**:
   - From the sketch, V1 is driving on the main road. In the crash summary, V1's road is described as:
     > "Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 1999 Ford Windstar, minivan was traveling east in the left eastbound lane of a five-lane, two-way bituminous urban road (two lanes eastbound, center turn lane, two lanes westbound)..."
   - Based on this, the main road is a five-lane, two-way road:
     - **No_ways_main_road** = 2
     - **No_lanes_main_road** = 5

2. **Identify Road Features for V2 (Branch Road)**:
   - From the sketch, V2 is driving on the branch road. In the crash summary, V2's road is described as:
     > "Vehicle two (V2), a 2005 Jeep Grand Cherokee, 4-door utility vehicle was traveling north in the northbound lane of a two-lane, two-way concrete road..."
   - Based on this, the branch road is a two-lane, two-way road:
     - **No_ways_branch_road** = 2
     - **No_lanes_branch_road** = 2

### Step 2 - Approximate Road Length and Lane Width from the Sketch

1. **Calculate the Length of the Main Road**:
   - From the sketch, V1 is on the main road, which extends horizontally across the image.
   - With a car length of 5 meters, the main road measures approximately 10 car lengths:
     - **Length_main_road** = 5 x 10 = 50 meters

2. **Calculate the Length of the Branch Road**:
   - From the sketch, V2 is on the branch road, which extends vertically from the bottom of the sketch to the intersection.
   - The branch road is approximately 2 car lengths:
     - **Length_branch_road** = 5 x 2 = 10 meters

3. **Estimate the Width of a Single Lane**:
   - The car on the road is centered in the lane, with a half-car width on each side.
   - Calculation: 2 + (2/2) + (2/2) = 4 meters
     - **Width** = 4 meters

### Step 3 - Validation
Verify the extracted values with the dataset:

- **No_ways_main_road** and **No_lanes_main_road**: Matches the crash summary’s description of a "five-lane, two-way road."
- **No_ways_branch_road** and **No_lanes_branch_road**: Matches the crash summary’s description of a "two-lane, two-way road."
- **Length_main** = 50 meters: Consistent with approximately 10 car lengths in the sketch.
- **Length_branch** = 10 meters: Consistent with approximately 2 car lengths in the sketch.
- **Width** = 4 meters: Consistent with the car’s width and lane spacing in the sketch.

Since all values align with the dataset, the validation result is **Passed**.

### Final Output
```python
{'No_ways_main_road': 2, 'No_lanes_main_road': 5, 'No_ways_branch_road': 2, 'No_lanes_branch_road': 2, 'Length_main': 50, 'Length_branch': 10, 'Width': 4, 'Validation': 'Passed'}
