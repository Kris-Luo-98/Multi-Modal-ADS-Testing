### Step 1 - Extract the Number of Ways and Lanes from Crash Summary

1. **Identify Road Details for V1 and V2**:
   - From the summary:
     > "Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2002 Chevrolet Trailblazer, 4-door utility vehicle was traveling east in the center left-turn lane of a five-lane, two-way roadway (two lanes westbound, center westbound left turn lane, two lanes eastbound) and was approaching a controlled four-leg intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 2002 Freightliner FLD-120, tractor pulling one trailer was traveling east in the right eastbound lane of the same roadway and was approaching the same intersection as V1."

2. **Extract Key Information**:
   - V1 is on a **five-lane, two-way roadway**:
     - **number_of_ways_v1 = 2** (since it's a two-way road)
     - **number_of_lanes_v1 = 5** (two lanes westbound, center left-turn lane, two lanes eastbound)
   - V2 is on the same **five-lane, two-way roadway**:
     - **number_of_ways_v2 = 2**
     - **number_of_lanes_v2 = 5**

3. **Determine Answers for Questions 1 and 2**:
   - For **question 1** (ways): Take the maximum value between `number_of_ways_v1` and `number_of_ways_v2` → **No_ways = 2**
   - For **question 2** (lanes): Take the maximum value between `number_of_lanes_v1` and `number_of_lanes_v2` → **No_lanes = 5**

### Step 2 - Approximate the Longest Distance Across the Intersection

1. **Analyze the Intersection in the Sketch**:
   - The intersection is a four-leg intersection with multiple lanes in each direction.

2. **Calculate Horizontal Road Length**:
   - V1 is on the horizontal road. The truck (V2) is approximately 20 meters long, and the horizontal road spans about 6 truck lengths.
   - Calculation: `20 x 6 = 120` meters

3. **Calculate Longitudinal Road Length**:
   - The vertical road is shorter, spanning about 4 truck lengths.
   - Calculation: `20 x 4 = 80` meters

4. **Determine Answer for Question 3**:
   - Take the maximum length between the horizontal and longitudinal roads → **Length = 120** meters

### Step 3 - Estimate Lane Width

1. **Determine Lane Width**:
   - Given that this is a five-lane road, the typical lane width is around **3.5 meters** per lane.

### Step 4 - Validation

Our answers are: `{'No_ways': 2, 'No_lanes': 5, 'Length': 120, 'Width': 3.5}`

Validation:
1. **No_ways**: Matches the summary’s description of a "two-way roadway."
2. **No_lanes**: Matches the summary’s description of a "five-lane roadway."
3. **Length**: 120 meters, consistent with the truck length (20 meters) and the sketch showing about 6 truck lengths.
4. **Width**: 3.5 meters, consistent with typical lane width for multi-lane roads.

Since all values align with the dataset, the validation is **Passed**.

### Final Output
```python
{'No_ways': 2, 'No_lanes': 5, 'Length': 120, 'Width': 3.5, 'Validation': 'Passed'}
```
