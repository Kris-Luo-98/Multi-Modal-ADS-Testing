### Analysis Process

#### Step 1 - Extract the Road Type
1. **Read the crash summary** to identify road features:
   - Example: "V1 was traveling on a curved, two-lane, two-way road, and V2 was also traveling on this curved road."
2. **Determine the road type** based on the description. For example:
   - If the summary describes a "curved road" with no intersections, classify the road as **Curve**.

#### Step 2 - Validation
1. **Focus on road boundaries** in the sketch:
   - Ignore vehicles, labels, and arrows. Observe the long, solid or dashed black lines representing road boundaries.
2. **Confirm road type**:
   - For a curved road, look for **parallel curved lines** extending from one side of the sketch to the other, with no intersecting roads.

3. If the sketch details match the road type extracted from the summary, confirm the road type as validated.

### Output
Provide the result in this format, without quotation marks:
{'Road type': Curve, 'Validation': Pass}
