### Step 1 - Extract the Road Type
From the crash summary:
- V1 was traveling north and approaching a **controlled four-leg intersection**.
- V2 was traveling east on the intersecting road.
- The crash occurred at the **intersection**.

Based on this description, the road type is clearly an **Intersection**.

### Step 2 - Validation
From the sketch:
- The road network shows **four roads** meeting at a central point, forming a **cross-shaped intersection**.
- There are **stop signs** for the northbound and southbound traffic, confirming the controlled nature of the intersection.

The sketch confirms the road type as an **Intersection**.

### Output
{'Road type': Intersection, 'Validation': Pass}
