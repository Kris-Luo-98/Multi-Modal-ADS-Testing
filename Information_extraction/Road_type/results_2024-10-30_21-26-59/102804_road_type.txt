### Step 1 - Extract the Road Type
From the crash summary:
- V1 was traveling east in the eastbound lane of a **two-lane, two-way roadway**.
- There is no mention of curves, intersections, or merging roads.
- The road is described as straight, with V2 blocking the lane due to a previous crash.

Based on this description, the road type is **Straight**.

### Step 2 - Validation
From the sketch:
- The road is depicted as **two parallel straight lines** with dashed lane markings in the center, indicating a two-lane, two-way road.
- There are no curves, intersections, or merging roads visible in the sketch.

The sketch confirms that the road is straight, so the validation **passes**.

### Output
{'Road type': Straight, 'Validation': Pass}
