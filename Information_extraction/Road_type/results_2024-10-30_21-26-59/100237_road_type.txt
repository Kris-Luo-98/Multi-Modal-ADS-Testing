### Step 1 - Extract the Road Type
From the crash summary:
- V1 was traveling east and approaching a **4-leg intersection**.
- V2 was traveling north and approaching the same intersection.

The description clearly indicates that the crash occurred at a **4-leg intersection**, which matches the definition of an **Intersection** (formed by crossing roads with four openings).

### Step 2 - Validation
From the sketch:
- The road network shows **four openings** (north, south, east, and west), confirming the presence of an **Intersection**.
- There are no additional road types (e.g., curves, merges, or T-intersections) depicted.

The sketch confirms the road type as an **Intersection**.

### Output
{'Road type': Intersection, 'Validation': Pass}
