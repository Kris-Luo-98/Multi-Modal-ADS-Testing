### Step 1 - Extract the Road Type
From the crash summary:
- The road is described as a **four-lane, two-way road** (two lanes northbound, two lanes southbound).
- There is no mention of any intersections, curves, or merging lanes.
- The crash occurred on a **straight section** of the road.

Thus, based on the summary, the road type is **Straight**.

### Step 2 - Validation
From the sketch:
- The road is depicted with **parallel straight lines** representing the lanes, with no curves or intersections visible.
- The road has **four lanes** (two in each direction), matching the description in the summary.

The sketch confirms that the road is straight, so the validation passes.

### Output
{'Road type': Straight, 'Validation': Pass}
