### Step 1 - Extract the Road Type
From the crash summary:
- V1 was traveling on a private road and approaching a **T-intersection**.
- V2 was traveling on a different road and also approaching the same **T-intersection**.

Based on this description, the road type is clearly a **T-intersection**.

### Step 2 - Validation
Looking at the sketch:
- The road network shows a **T-shaped configuration** with three openings: one vertical road and one horizontal road.
- There are no additional intersecting roads, confirming the **T-intersection** layout.

### Output
{'Road type': T-intersection, 'Validation': Pass}
