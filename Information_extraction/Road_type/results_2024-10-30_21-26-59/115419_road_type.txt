### Step 1 - Extract the Road Type
From the crash summary:
- The summary describes a **4-leg intersection** where two roads (a dirt road and a bituminous road) meet.
- This clearly indicates that the road type is an **Intersection**.

### Step 2 - Validation
From the sketch:
- The sketch shows a **4-leg intersection** with four road openings, confirming the description in the summary.
- The road boundaries are clearly depicted, with no curves or merging roads, further validating that this is an intersection.

### Output
{'Road type': Intersection, 'Validation': Pass}
