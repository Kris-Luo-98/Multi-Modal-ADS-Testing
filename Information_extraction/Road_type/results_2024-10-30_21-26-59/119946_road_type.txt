### Step 1 - Extract the Road Type
From the crash summary:
- V1 was traveling on a **freeway entrance ramp** that curves to the right and **merges** with the freeway.
- The description clearly mentions a **merging** scenario where the entrance ramp joins the freeway.

Thus, the road type extracted from the summary is **Merge**.

### Step 2 - Validation
From the sketch:
- The road network shows a **curved entrance ramp** that merges with a straight freeway.
- The curved lines of the ramp and the straight lines of the freeway confirm the merging scenario.

The sketch matches the road type extracted from the summary.

### Output
{'Road type': Merge, 'Validation': Pass}
