### Step 1 - Extract the Road Type
From the crash summary:
- V1 was traveling west in the right westbound lane of a **four-lane, two-way road**.
- V2 was traveling east in the eastbound lane of the same roadway.
- There is no mention of any intersections, curves, or merging roads.

This description suggests a **Straight** road.

### Step 2 - Validation
From the sketch:
- The road is depicted as a **straight, multi-lane road** with dashed lines separating the lanes.
- There are no curves, intersections, or merging roads visible in the sketch.

The sketch confirms that the road is **Straight**.

### Output
{'Road type': Straight, 'Validation': Pass}
