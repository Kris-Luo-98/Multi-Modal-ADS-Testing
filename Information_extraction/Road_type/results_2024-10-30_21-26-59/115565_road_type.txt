### Step 1 - Extract the Road Type
From the crash summary:
- V1 was approaching a **4-leg intersection** controlled by stop signs.
- V2 was also approaching the same intersection from a different direction.

This clearly describes a **4-leg intersection**, which matches the definition of an **Intersection** (formed by crossing roads with four openings).

### Step 2 - Validation
From the sketch:
- The road network shows **four distinct openings** (north, south, east, and west), confirming the presence of a **4-leg intersection**.
- There are no additional road types like curves or merges depicted.

### Output
The road type extracted from the summary matches the road network in the sketch.
