### Step 1 - Extract the Road Type
From the crash summary:
- The road is described as a **five-lane, two-way road** with two northbound lanes, two southbound lanes, and a center-turn lane.
- There is no mention of intersections, curves, or merging lanes.

This description suggests a **Straight** road.

### Step 2 - Validation
From the sketch:
- The road is depicted with **parallel straight lines** representing multiple lanes (two northbound, two southbound, and a center-turn lane).
- There are no curves, intersections, or merging lanes visible in the sketch.

The sketch confirms that the road is **Straight**.

### Output
{'Road type': Straight, 'Validation': Pass}
