### Step 1 - Extract the Road Type
From the crash summary:
- V1 was traveling north and V2 was traveling west, both approaching a **4-leg intersection**.
- The summary explicitly mentions a **4-leg intersection**.

Thus, the road type is **Intersection**.

### Step 2 - Validation
From the sketch:
- The road network shows **four openings** (north, south, east, and west), confirming a **4-leg intersection**.
- There are no additional roads or features that would suggest a different road type.

The sketch matches the road type extracted from the summary.

### Output:
`{'Road type': Intersection, 'Validation': Pass}`
