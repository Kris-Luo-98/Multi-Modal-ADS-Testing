### Step 1 - Extract the Road Type
From the crash summary:
- V1 was traveling north on a three-lane, two-way road and approaching a **four-leg intersection**.
- V2 was traveling west on a three-lane, two-way road and approaching the **same intersection**.

The description clearly indicates that the crash occurred at a **four-leg intersection**.

### Step 2 - Validation
From the sketch:
- The road network shows **four roads** meeting at a central point, with **four openings**.
- There are no additional roads merging or forming a T-shape, confirming that this is a **four-leg intersection**.

### Output
The road type extracted from the summary matches the road network depicted in the sketch.

{'Road type': Intersection, 'Validation': Pass}
