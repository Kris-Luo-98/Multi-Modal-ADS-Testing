### Step 1 - Extract the Road Type
From the crash summary:
- Both vehicles (V1 and V2) were traveling on a **two-lane, two-way rural road**.
- There is no mention of any intersections, curves, or merging roads.
- The road is described as straight, with V2 crossing the center line due to icy conditions.

Based on this, the road type is **Straight**.

### Step 2 - Validation
From the sketch:
- The road is depicted as two parallel straight lines with dashed center lines, indicating a **two-lane, two-way road**.
- There are no curves, intersections, or merging roads visible in the sketch.

The sketch confirms that the road is **Straight**.

### Output
{'Road type': Straight, 'Validation': Pass}
