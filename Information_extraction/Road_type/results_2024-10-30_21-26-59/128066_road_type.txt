### Step 1 - Extract the Road Type
From the crash summary:
- V1 was traveling south and approaching a **four-leg intersection**.
- V2 was traveling west and also approaching the **same four-leg intersection**.

Based on this description, the road type is clearly an **Intersection**.

### Step 2 - Validation
Looking at the sketch:
- The road network shows **four roads** meeting at a central point, forming a **four-leg intersection**.
- There are no other road types (e.g., curves, merges, or T-intersections) visible in the sketch.

The sketch confirms the road type as an **Intersection**.

### Output
{'Road type': Intersection, 'Validation': Pass}
