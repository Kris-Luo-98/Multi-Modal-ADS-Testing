### Step 1 - Extract the Road Type
From the crash summary:
- Both vehicles (V1 and V2) were approaching a **four-leg intersection**.
- The summary explicitly mentions that both vehicles were passing through the intersection.

Based on this description, the road type is clearly an **Intersection**.

### Step 2 - Validation
From the sketch:
- The road network shows **four openings** (north, south, east, and west), confirming a **four-leg intersection**.
- There are no additional road types (e.g., curves, merges) depicted.

The sketch matches the road type extracted from the summary.

### Output
{'Road type': Intersection, 'Validation': Pass}
