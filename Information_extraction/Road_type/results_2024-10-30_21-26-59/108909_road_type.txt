### Step 1 - Extract the Road Type
From the crash summary:
- V1 was traveling on a **one-way entrance ramp** and attempting to enter the right westbound lane of a **divided, limited-access freeway**.
- This description indicates a **Merge** scenario, where the entrance ramp merges into the freeway.

### Step 2 - Validation
From the sketch:
- The road network shows a **curved entrance ramp** merging into a **straight freeway** with multiple lanes.
- The curved road (entrance ramp) meets the straight road (freeway), confirming a **Merge**.

### Output
{'Road type': Merge, 'Validation': Pass}
