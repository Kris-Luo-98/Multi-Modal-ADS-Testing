### Step 1 - Extract the Road Type
From the crash summary:
- Both vehicles (V1 and V2) were traveling on a **two-lane, two-way roadway**.
- There is no mention of any curves, intersections, or merging roads.
- The road is described as straight, with V2 drifting across the centerline.

Based on this description, the road type is **Straight**.

### Step 2 - Validation
From the sketch:
- The road is depicted as two parallel straight lines with dashed centerlines, indicating a **two-lane, two-way roadway**.
- There are no intersecting roads, curves, or merging lanes visible in the sketch.

The sketch confirms that the road is **Straight**.

### Output
{'Road type': Straight, 'Validation': Pass}
