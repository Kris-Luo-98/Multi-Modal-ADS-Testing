### Step 1 - Extract the Road Type
From the crash summary:
- Both vehicles (V1 and V2) were traveling on a **curved, two-lane, two-way roadway**.
- V1 was negotiating a right curve, and V2 was negotiating a left curve.

Based on this description, the road type is clearly a **Curve**.

### Step 2 - Validation
Looking at the sketch:
- The road is depicted with **curved parallel lines** extending from one side of the image to the other.
- There are no intersecting roads or additional openings, confirming that this is a **curved road**.

The sketch matches the description from the summary, so the road type is validated.

### Output
{'Road type': Curve, 'Validation': Pass}
