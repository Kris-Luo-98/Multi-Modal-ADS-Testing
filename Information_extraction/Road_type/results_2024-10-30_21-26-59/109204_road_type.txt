### Step 1 - Extract the Road Type
From the crash summary:
- The crash occurred at a **controlled four-leg intersection**.
- Both vehicles were approaching the same intersection.

Based on this description, the road type is clearly an **Intersection**.

### Step 2 - Validation
Looking at the sketch:
- The road network shows **four openings** (north, south, east, and west), confirming a **four-leg intersection**.
- There are no other road types (e.g., T-intersection, curve, or merge) depicted.

The sketch matches the road type described in the summary.

### Output
{'Road type': Intersection, 'Validation': Pass}
