### Step 1 - Extract the Road Type
From the crash summary:
- V1 was traveling on a **two-lane, two-way bituminous rural highway**.
- V2 was traveling on a **two-lane, two-way gravel road**.
- Both vehicles were approaching a **four-leg intersection**.

Based on this description, the road type is an **Intersection**.

### Step 2 - Validation
From the sketch:
- The road network shows **four openings** (north, south, east, and west), confirming a **four-leg intersection**.
- There are no curves or merging roads, and the layout clearly depicts an intersection.

The sketch matches the road type extracted from the summary.

### Output
{'Road type': Intersection, 'Validation': Pass}
