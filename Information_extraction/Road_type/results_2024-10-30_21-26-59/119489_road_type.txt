### Step 1 - Extract the Road Type
From the crash summary:
- V1 was stopped in a **commercial driveway** and was attempting to turn left onto a **north-south two-lane, two-way road**.
- V2 was traveling north on the same road.

This description suggests that the crash occurred at a **T-intersection**, where the commercial driveway meets the main road.

### Step 2 - Validation
Looking at the sketch:
- The road network shows a **T-shaped configuration** where the commercial driveway (on the left) meets the main road (running north-south).
- There are no other intersecting roads, confirming the **T-intersection**.

### Output
{'Road type': T-intersection, 'Validation': Pass}
