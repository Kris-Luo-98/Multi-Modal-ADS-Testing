### Step 1 - Extract the Road Type
From the crash summary:
- The vehicles were traveling on a **two-lane, two-way rural roadway**.
- There is no mention of any intersections, curves, or merging lanes.
- The road is described as straight, with vehicles traveling in opposite directions.

Based on this description, the road type is **Straight**.

### Step 2 - Validation
From the sketch:
- The road is depicted as two parallel straight lanes, with dashed lines separating the lanes.
- There are no curves, intersections, or merging lanes visible in the sketch.

The sketch confirms that the road is **Straight**.

### Output
{'Road type': Straight, 'Validation': Pass}
