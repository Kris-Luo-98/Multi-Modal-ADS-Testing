### Step 1 - Extract the Road Type
From the crash summary:
- V1 was traveling north on a two-lane, two-way rural roadway.
- V2 was traveling east on an intersecting two-lane, two-way roadway.
- Both vehicles entered a **four-leg intersection** at the same time.

Based on this description, the road type is clearly an **Intersection**.

### Step 2 - Validation
From the sketch:
- The road network shows two roads crossing each other, forming a **four-leg intersection**.
- There are no additional roads or merging lanes, confirming the road type as an **Intersection**.

### Output
{'Road type': Intersection, 'Validation': Pass}
