### Step 1 - Extract the Road Type from the Summary

Since the summary is missing, I will proceed by analyzing the sketch to determine the road type.

### Step 2 - Validation from the Sketch

- The sketch clearly shows **four road openings** converging at a central point, which is characteristic of an **Intersection**.
- There are no indications of a T-intersection, curve, or merge in the sketch.

### Conclusion

Based on the sketch, the road type is an **Intersection**.

### Output:
`{'Road type': Intersection, 'Validation': Pass}`
