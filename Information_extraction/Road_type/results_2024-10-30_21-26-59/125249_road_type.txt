### Step 1 - Extract the Road Type
From the crash summary:
- The summary describes a **4-leg intersection** where both vehicles were approaching from opposite directions.
- This clearly indicates that the road type is an **Intersection**.

### Step 2 - Validation
From the sketch:
- The road network shows **four openings** (north, south, east, and west), confirming the presence of a **4-leg intersection**.
- There are no other road types (e.g., curves, merges) depicted in the sketch.

### Output
Since the road type extracted from the summary matches the road network in the sketch, the validation passes.

```python
{'Road type': Intersection, 'Validation': Pass}
```
