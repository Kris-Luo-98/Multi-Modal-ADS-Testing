### Step 1 - Extract the Road Type
From the crash summary:
- The crash occurred at a **four-leg intersection**.
- Both vehicles were traveling on a two-way urban road and collided at the intersection.

Based on this description, the road type is clearly an **Intersection**.

### Step 2 - Validation
From the sketch:
- The road network shows a **four-leg intersection** with four openings, confirming the description in the summary.
- There are no additional roads or merging lanes, and the vehicles are positioned within the intersection.

The sketch matches the road type extracted from the summary.

### Output
{'Road type': Intersection, 'Validation': Pass}
