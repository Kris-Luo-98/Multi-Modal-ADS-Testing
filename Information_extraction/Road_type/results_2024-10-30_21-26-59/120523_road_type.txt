### Step 1 - Extract the Road Type
From the crash summary:
- Both vehicles (V1 and V2) were traveling on a **two-lane, two-way rural road**.
- There is no mention of any intersections, curves, or merging lanes.
- The road is described as having a **positive (uphill) and negative (downhill) grade**, but it is otherwise a straight road.

Based on this description, the road type is **Straight**.

### Step 2 - Validation
Looking at the sketch:
- The road is depicted as **two parallel straight lines** with dashed lines in the center, indicating a two-lane, two-way road.
- There are no curves, intersections, or merging lanes visible in the sketch.

The sketch confirms that the road is **Straight**.

### Output
{'Road type': Straight, 'Validation': Pass}
