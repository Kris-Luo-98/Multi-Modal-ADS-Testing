### Step 1 - Extract the Road Type
From the crash summary:
- V1 was traveling east on a three-lane, two-way urban road and entered a **four-leg intersection**.
- V2 was traveling south on an intersecting road, and both vehicles entered the intersection at the same time.

Based on this description, the road type is clearly an **Intersection**.

### Step 2 - Validation
Looking at the sketch:
- The road network shows **four openings** (north, south, east, and west), which confirms the presence of a **four-leg intersection**.
- There are no other road types (e.g., curves, merges, or T-intersections) depicted.

Thus, the sketch confirms the road type as an **Intersection**.

### Output
{'Road type': Intersection, 'Validation': Pass}
