### Step 1 - Extract the Road Type
From the crash summary:
- The road is described as a **two-lane, two-way rural road**.
- There is no mention of any intersections, merges, or curves.
- The vehicles are traveling in opposite directions on a straight road, with one vehicle losing control and crossing the centerline.

Based on this description, the road type is most likely **Straight**.

### Step 2 - Validation
Looking at the sketch:
- The road is depicted as two parallel straight lines with dashed centerlines, indicating a two-lane, two-way road.
- There are no intersecting roads, curves, or merging lanes visible in the sketch.

The sketch confirms that the road is **Straight**.

### Output
{'Road type': Straight, 'Validation': Pass}
