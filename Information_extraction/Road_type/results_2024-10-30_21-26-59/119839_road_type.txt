### Step 1 - Extract the Road Type
From the crash summary:
- V1 was traveling on a five-lane, two-way road and was approaching a **T-intersection**.
- V2 was traveling on a two-lane, two-way road that intersected with the east-west road.
- The crash occurred at a **T-intersection**.

Based on this description, the road type is **T-intersection**.

### Step 2 - Validation
From the sketch:
- The road network shows a main road with multiple lanes (east-west) and a smaller road (north-south) intersecting it.
- The smaller road ends at the main road, forming a **T-shape**.
- There are no other intersecting roads, confirming the **T-intersection**.

### Output
The road type extracted from the summary matches the road network depicted in the sketch.

`{'Road type': T-intersection, 'Validation': Pass}`
