### Step 1 - Extract the Road Type
From the crash summary:
- Both vehicles (V1 and V2) were traveling in opposite directions on a **two-lane, two-way, rural roadway**.
- There is no mention of any intersections, curves, or merging roads.
- The road is described as **straight**.

Thus, based on the summary, the road type is **Straight**.

### Step 2 - Validation
From the sketch:
- The road is depicted as **two parallel straight lines** with no intersections, curves, or merging roads.
- The vehicles are shown traveling in opposite directions on a straight road, consistent with the summary.

The sketch confirms that the road is **Straight**.

### Output
{'Road type': Straight, 'Validation': Pass}
