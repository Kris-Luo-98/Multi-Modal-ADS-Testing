### Step 1 - Extract the Road Type
From the crash summary:
- The crash occurred on an **eight-lane, limited access freeway** with **four lanes eastbound** and **four lanes westbound**, separated by a **protected median/divider**.
- There is no mention of intersections, curves, or merging lanes.

Based on this description, the road type is classified as **Straight**.

### Step 2 - Validation
From the sketch:
- The road is depicted as a **multi-lane, straight roadway** with dashed lane markings and no curves or intersections.
- The road extends horizontally across the sketch, confirming that it is a straight road.

The sketch matches the road type extracted from the summary.

### Output
{'Road type': Straight, 'Validation': Pass}
