### Step 1 - Extract the Road Type
From the crash summary:
- V1 was traveling on a **freeway** with three eastbound lanes.
- V2 was traveling on an **entrance ramp** and attempting to merge onto the freeway.
- The crash occurred at the **merging point** where the entrance ramp meets the freeway.

Based on this description, the road type is a **Merge**.

### Step 2 - Validation
From the sketch:
- The road network shows a **freeway** with multiple lanes and an **entrance ramp** merging into the freeway.
- The vehicles are positioned at the merging point, confirming the description from the summary.

The sketch clearly depicts a **Merge** scenario, so the road type is validated.

### Output
`{'Road type': Merge, 'Validation': Pass}`
