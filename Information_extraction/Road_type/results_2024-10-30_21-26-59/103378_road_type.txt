### Step 1 - Extract the Road Type
From the crash summary:
- V1 and V2 were traveling on a **two-lane, two-way rural road**.
- There is no mention of any curves, intersections, or merging roads.
- The crash occurred when V1 drifted across the centerline into the opposite lane.

Based on this description, the road type is most likely **Straight**.

### Step 2 - Validation
From the sketch:
- The road network shows **two roads crossing each other**, forming four openings.
- This is clearly an **Intersection**.

### Conclusion:
The road type extracted from the summary (Straight) does not match the road type depicted in the sketch (Intersection). Therefore, the validation fails.

### Output:
`{'Road type': Intersection, 'Validation': Fail}`
