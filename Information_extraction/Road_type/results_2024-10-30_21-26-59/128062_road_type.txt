### Step 1 - Extract the Road Type
From the crash summary:
- V1 was traveling south on a five-lane, two-way urban roadway and was approaching a **four-leg intersection**.
- V2 was traveling north and was also approaching the same intersection with the intention of turning left.

Based on this description, the road type is clearly an **Intersection**.

### Step 2 - Validation
From the sketch:
- The road network shows multiple lanes converging at a point, with roads extending in four directions, which is characteristic of a **four-leg intersection**.
- There are no curved roads or merging lanes, and the road boundaries confirm the presence of an intersection.

### Output
Since the sketch confirms the road type described in the summary, the validation passes.

{'Road type': Intersection, 'Validation': Pass}
