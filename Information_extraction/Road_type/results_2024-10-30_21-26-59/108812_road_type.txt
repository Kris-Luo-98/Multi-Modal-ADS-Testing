### Step 1 - Extract the Road Type
From the crash summary:
- Both vehicles (V1 and V2) were traveling on a **two-lane, two-way rural roadway**.
- Both vehicles were **negotiating a slight curve** (V1 to the left, V2 to the right).
- There is no mention of intersections, merges, or T-intersections.

Based on this description, the road type is a **Curve**.

### Step 2 - Validation
From the sketch:
- The road is depicted with **curved parallel lines** extending from one side of the sketch to the other.
- There are no intersecting roads or additional openings, confirming that this is a **curved road**.

The sketch matches the road type extracted from the summary.

### Output
{'Road type': Curve, 'Validation': Pass}
