### Step 1 - Extract the Road Type
From the crash summary:
- Both vehicles (V1 and V2) were traveling on a **curved road**.
- V1 was negotiating a left curve, and V2 was negotiating a right curve.
- There is no mention of intersections, merges, or straight sections.

Based on this, the road type is **Curve**.

### Step 2 - Validation
From the sketch:
- The road is depicted with **curved parallel lines** extending from one side of the sketch to the other.
- There are no intersecting roads or merging lanes visible.
- The road curvature matches the description in the summary.

Thus, the sketch confirms the road type as **Curve**.

### Output
{'Road type': Curve, 'Validation': Pass}
