### Step 1 - Extract the Road Type
From the crash summary:
- V1 was traveling south on a two-lane, two-way rural road.
- V2 was traveling east on an intersecting two-lane, two-way road.
- Both vehicles entered a **four-leg intersection**.

Based on this description, the road type is clearly an **Intersection**.

### Step 2 - Validation
Looking at the sketch:
- The road network shows a **four-leg intersection** with roads extending in four directions (north, south, east, and west).
- There are no additional road features like curves or merges, confirming that this is a standard intersection.

### Output
Since the sketch confirms the road type described in the summary, the validation passes.

```python
{'Road type': Intersection, 'Validation': Pass}
```
