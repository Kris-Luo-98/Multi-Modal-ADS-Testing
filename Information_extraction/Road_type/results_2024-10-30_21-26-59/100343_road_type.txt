### Step 1 - Extract the Road Type
From the crash summary:
- The road is described as a **"limited access, four-lane, divided freeway"** with two lanes in each direction and an open median.
- There is no mention of intersections, curves, or merging lanes.

Based on this description, the road type is classified as **Straight**.

### Step 2 - Validation
From the sketch:
- The road is depicted as a **straight, divided freeway** with two lanes in each direction, separated by an unprotected median.
- There are no intersecting roads, curves, or merging lanes visible in the sketch.

The sketch confirms the road type as **Straight**.

### Output
{'Road type': Straight, 'Validation': Pass}
