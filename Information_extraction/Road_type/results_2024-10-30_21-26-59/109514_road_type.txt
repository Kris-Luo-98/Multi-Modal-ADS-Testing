### Step 1 - Extract the Road Type
From the crash summary:
- The road is described as a **five-lane, two-way roadway** with two lanes in each direction and a center turn lane.
- There is no mention of any intersections, curves, or merging lanes.
- The crash occurred while V1 was attempting to turn left across the eastbound lanes from the center turn lane.

Based on this description, the road type is most likely **Straight**.

### Step 2 - Validation
From the sketch:
- The road is depicted as a **straight, multi-lane road** with dashed lines separating the lanes.
- There is a center turn lane, and no intersecting roads or curves are visible.
- The road boundaries are straight and parallel, confirming that this is a straight road.

### Output
The road type extracted from the summary matches the road type depicted in the sketch.

{'Road type': Straight, 'Validation': Pass}
