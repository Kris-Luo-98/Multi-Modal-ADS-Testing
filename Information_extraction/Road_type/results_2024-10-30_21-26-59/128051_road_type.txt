### Step 1 - Extract the Road Type
From the crash summary, we can extract the following road features:
- The crash occurred on a **four-lane, two-way roadway** (two lanes northbound, two lanes southbound).
- There is no mention of any curves or merging lanes.
- The crash occurred as V2 crossed the centerline into the path of V1, indicating a straight road.

Based on this description, the road type is likely **Straight**.

### Step 2 - Validation
Now, let's validate this against the sketch:
- The sketch shows **parallel straight lines** representing the road boundaries, with no curves or intersections.
- The road is divided into **four lanes** (two northbound and two southbound), matching the description in the summary.
- There are no intersecting roads or merging lanes visible in the sketch.

Since the sketch confirms a straight road with no intersections or curves, the road type is validated as **Straight**.

### Output
{'Road type': Straight, 'Validation': Pass}
