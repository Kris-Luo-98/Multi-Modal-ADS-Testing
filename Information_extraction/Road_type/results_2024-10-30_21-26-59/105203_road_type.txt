### Step 1 - Extract the Road Type
From the crash summary:
- V1, V2, and V3 were all traveling on a **two-lane, two-way rural roadway**.
- There is no mention of any intersections, merges, or curves.
- The road is described as straight, with V1 attempting to avoid V2 and entering the eastbound lane.

Based on this description, the road type is **Straight**.

### Step 2 - Validation
Looking at the sketch:
- The road is depicted as a **straight, two-lane road** with no curves or intersections.
- The vehicles are shown traveling in opposite directions on a straight road, confirming the description in the summary.

The sketch matches the road type extracted from the summary.

### Output
{'Road type': Straight, 'Validation': Pass}
