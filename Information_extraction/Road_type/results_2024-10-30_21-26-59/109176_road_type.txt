### Step 1 - Extract the Road Type
From the crash summary:
- The road is described as a **4-lane, divided, limited access freeway** with two lanes in each direction (southbound and northbound), separated by an unprotected median.
- There is no mention of intersections, curves, or merging lanes.

Based on this description, the road type is **Straight**.

### Step 2 - Validation
From the sketch:
- The road is depicted as a **straight, divided freeway** with two lanes in each direction, separated by a grassy median.
- There are no intersecting roads, curves, or merging lanes visible in the sketch.

The sketch confirms that the road is straight, so the validation passes.

### Output
{'Road type': Straight, 'Validation': Pass}
