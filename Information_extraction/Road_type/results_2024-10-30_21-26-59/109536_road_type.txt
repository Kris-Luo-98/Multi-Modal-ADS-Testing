### Step 1 - Extract the Road Type
From the crash summary:
- V1 was traveling north on a **two-lane, two-way rural roadway**.
- V1 was **exiting a right curve**, and V2 was about to **enter the curve** from the opposite direction.
- There is no mention of intersections or merging roads, and the road is described as curved.

Based on this description, the road type is **Curve**.

### Step 2 - Validation
From the sketch:
- The road boundaries are depicted as **curved lines** extending from one side of the sketch to the other.
- There are no intersecting roads or merging lanes visible in the sketch.
- The road is clearly curved, matching the description in the summary.

### Output
The road type extracted from the summary matches the road type depicted in the sketch.

`{'Road type': Curve, 'Validation': Pass}`
