Based on the provided summary, here is the extracted environmental information and validation:

1. **Weather**: The summary states "the sky was clear," which corresponds to **Sunny**.
2. **Time**: The summary mentions "It was daylight," which corresponds to **Daytime**.

Now, let's validate the extracted information:

- **Weather**: "Sunny" corresponds to "the sky was clear" in the summary.
- **Time**: "Daytime" corresponds to "It was daylight" in the summary.

Since both the weather and time match the description in the summary, the validation **passes**.

Here is the final output:

```json
{
   "Weather": "Sunny",
   "Time": "Daytime",
   "Validation": "Passed"
}
```
