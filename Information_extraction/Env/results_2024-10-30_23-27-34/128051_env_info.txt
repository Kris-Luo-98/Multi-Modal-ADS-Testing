### Step 1: Environment Information Extraction
From the summary, we can locate the sentence describing the weather and time:  
- "It was daylight, the weather was clear, and the bituminous road surface was dry."

- **Weather**: The word "clear" corresponds to "Sunny."
- **Time**: The word "daylight" corresponds to "Daytime."

### Step 2: Validation
We bring the extracted answers back to the crash summary for validation:
- **Weather**: Our answer "Sunny" corresponds to "clear" in the crash summary.
- **Time**: Our answer "Daytime" corresponds to "daylight" in the crash summary.

Validation passed!

### Final Output:
```json
{
   "Weather": "Sunny",
   "Time": "Daytime",
   "Validation": "Passed"
}
```
