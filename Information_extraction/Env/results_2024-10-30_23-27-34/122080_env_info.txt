Based on the provided summary, here is the extracted information and validation:

1. **Weather**: The summary states "the weather was clear," which corresponds to "Sunny."
2. **Time**: The summary mentions "It was daylight," which corresponds to "Daytime."

Now, let's validate the extracted information:

- **Weather**: "Sunny" corresponds to "clear" in the summary.
- **Time**: "Daytime" corresponds to "daylight" in the summary.

Since both the weather and time match the description in the summary, the validation passes.

Here is the final output:

```json
{
   "Weather": "Sunny",
   "Time": "Daytime",
   "Validation": "Passed"
}
```
