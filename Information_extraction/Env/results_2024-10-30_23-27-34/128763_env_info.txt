### Step 1: Environment Information Extraction

From the summary, we can locate the sentence describing the weather and time:  
- "It was daylight, raining, and the bituminous road surface was wet."

- **Weather**: The word "raining" indicates the weather is "Rainy."
- **Time**: The word "daylight" indicates the time is "Daytime."

### Step 2: Validation

We bring the extracted answers back to the crash summary for validation:
- **Weather**: Our answer "Rainy" corresponds to "raining" in the crash summary.
- **Time**: Our answer "Daytime" corresponds to "daylight" in the crash summary.

Validation passed!

### Final Output:

```json
{
   "Weather": "Rainy",
   "Time": "Daytime",
   "Validation": "Passed"
}
```
