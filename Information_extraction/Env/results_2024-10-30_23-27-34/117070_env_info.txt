1. **Weather**: The summary states "the weather was clear," which corresponds to "Sunny."
2. **Time**: The summary mentions "It was dark with no streetlights," which corresponds to "Nighttime."

### Validation:
- **Weather**: "Sunny" corresponds to "clear" in the summary.
- **Time**: "Nighttime" corresponds to "dark with no streetlights" in the summary.

Since the time is 'Nighttime' so the weather should be 'Not mentioned'.
The validation passes.
