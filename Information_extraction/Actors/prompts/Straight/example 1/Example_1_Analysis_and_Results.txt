Based on the provided crash summary and sketch, here is the trajectory analysis for the vehicles involved:

# Road Setup
- Road Type: Straight, two-way road with two lanes (one lane for each direction).
- Road Length: 60 meters.
- Lane Width: 4 meters per lane.

# Vehicle Details and Initial Observations
- V1: 2005 Ford Focus, 4-door sedan (Type: Car)
Traveling northbound in the northbound lane.
Experienced a loss of control, crossed into the southbound lane, and collided with V2.

- V2: 1983 Buick Riviera, 2-door coupe (Type: Car)
Traveling southbound in the southbound lane.
Attempted to avoid V1 but was struck frontally in an offset collision.

# Trajectory Estimation
V1 (Ford Focus)
1. Starting Position: Northbound lane, near the bottom of the sketch.
2. Movement: Crossed over the centerline into the southbound lane.
3. Collision Point: In the center of the dividing line of a two-way road, roughly around the midpoint of the road length (approximately X=30, Y=4.5).
4. Post-Collision: No need to consider the trajectory of the vehicle after the collision point.
V2 (Buick Riviera)
1. Starting Position: Southbound lane, near the top of the sketch.
2. Movement: Continued in its lane and tried to avoid V1 by veering slightly but was struck by V1.
3. Collision Point: In the center of the dividing line of a two-way road, roughly around the midpoint of the road length (approximately X=30, Y=4.5).
4. Post-Collision: No need to consider the trajectory of the vehicle after the collision point.

# Output
Based on the above observations, here are the estimated trajectories:

{
  "V1_traj": [(5, 2), (15, 2), (25, 2), (30, 4.5)],
  "V1_type": "Car",
  "V2_traj": [(55, 6), (45, 6), (35, 6), (30, 4.5)],
  "V2_type": "Car",
  "Validation": "Passed"
}
