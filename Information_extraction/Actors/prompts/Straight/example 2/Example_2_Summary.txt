Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2002 Ford Explorer, 4-door utility vehicle was traveling south in the southbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural road. Vehicle two (V2 - case vehicle), a 2003 Ford Explorer Sport Trac, 4-door pickup truck was traveling north in the northbound lane of the same road. It was dark, the sky was cloudy, and the bituminous road surface was wet from a previous rain. As the two vehicles approached each other, the driver of V1 reportedly fell asleep and V1 crossed the centerline and into the northbound lane. The driver of V2 was unable to avoid V1 and the front of V1 struck the front of V2 in an offset-frontal configuration. After impact, V1 rotated counter clockwise approximately 180 degrees and came to rest in the southbound lane facing north-northwest, while V2 rotated counterclockwise approximately 80 degrees and came to rest off the east shoulder facing west-northwest. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage. The 48-year-old female driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. She was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital and was later transferred to a regional level-one trauma center with serious (AIS-3) injuries. The 51-year-old female driver of V2 (case occupant) was also using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. She was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with critical (AIS-5) injuries.
