Analysis Process
Step 1: Road Network and Coordinate System Setup
Road Type: Intersection (4-leg).
Lane Configuration: Two-lane, two-way rural road (one lane in each direction).
Lane Width: 3.5 meters.
Coordinate System: Origin is set at the center of the intersection, with the X-axis extending horizontally (east-west) and the Y-axis extending vertically (north-south).
Step 2: Identifying Vehicle Information
Vehicle 1 (V1):
Type: Car (1998 Cadillac Catera).
Initial Direction: Northbound in the northbound lane.
Path: Traveling straight through the intersection.
Vehicle 2 (V2):
Type: Car (1994 GMC Vandura 2500).
Initial Direction: Eastbound in the eastbound lane.
Path: Traveling straight through the intersection.
Step 3: Determine Starting Points, Collision Point, and Final Positions
Based on the provided output:

V1 Trajectory:

Starting Point: (2, -20), approaching the intersection in the northbound lane.
Intermediate Points: Moves northward through (2, -10).
Collision Point: Center of the intersection at (2, 0).
V2 Trajectory:

Starting Point: (-20, -2), approaching the intersection in the eastbound lane.
Intermediate Points: Moves eastward through (-10, -2).
Collision Point: Center of the intersection at (0, -2).
Step 4: Analysis of the Collision Dynamics
Collision Configuration: The collision occurred at the center of the intersection, with the front of V2 striking the left side of V1 in an L-type configuration.
Post-Collision Dynamics:
V1 continued moving slightly forward after the impact, remaining within the northbound lane.
V2 continued slightly forward after the impact, remaining in the eastbound lane.
No significant post-impact rotation or departure from the intersection was indicated in this output.
Step 5: Validation
Validation Check: Confirmed that both trajectories match the provided data and remain in-lane with no rotational displacement or redirection after the collision.
Summary of Final Output

{
  "V1_traj": [(2, -20), (2, -10), (2, 0)],
  "V1_type": "Car",
  "V2_traj": [(-20, -2), (-10, -2), (0, -2)],
  "V2_type": "Car",
  "Validation": "Passed"
}
