Road Network and Coordinate Setup
Road Type: Intersection (4-leg).
Lane Configuration: Two-lane, two-way road in each direction.
Lane Width: 4 meters per lane.
Coordinate System: Origin at the center of the intersection, with the X-axis extending horizontally and the Y-axis vertically.
Vehicle and Collision Information
V1: 2004 Ford Taurus (Sedan), traveling south in the southbound lane.
V2: 1997 Chevrolet Lumina (Sedan), traveling east in the eastbound lane.
Collision Point: Center of the intersection, where V1’s front struck the left side of V2 in an L-type configuration.
Post-Collision Dynamics:
V1 rotated counterclockwise, and V2 rotated clockwise, resulting in a side-slap between V1’s right side and V2’s left side.
Both vehicles departed the southeast corner of the intersection and came to rest in a plowed agricultural field, facing south-southeast.
