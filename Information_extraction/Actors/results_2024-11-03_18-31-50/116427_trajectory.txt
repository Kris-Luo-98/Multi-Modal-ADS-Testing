Analysis and Output for the Crash Case
1. Road Setup
Road Type: Two-lane, two-way rural highway (one lane in each direction: northbound and southbound).
Road Length: 50 meters.
Lane Width: 4 meters per lane.
Grade: 1% positive grade in the northbound direction.
2. Vehicle Identification
Vehicle 1 (V1): 2003 Saturn LW300, 4-door station wagon (classified as Car).

Movement: Traveling north in the northbound lane.
Collision Sequence:
Crossed the centerline into the southbound lane for an unknown reason.
Collided with V2 in an offset frontal collision.
Post-collision: Rotated counterclockwise and came to rest in the northbound lane facing west.
Vehicle 2 (V2): 2003 Cadillac CTS, 4-door sedan (classified as Car).

Movement: Traveling south in the southbound lane.
Collision Sequence:
Attempted to steer right to avoid V1 but could not avoid the collision.
Collided with V1 in an offset frontal collision.
Post-collision: Rotated counterclockwise and came to rest partially on the west shoulder facing south-southeast.
3. Coordinate System and Trajectory Mapping
The origin is set at the bottom-left of the northbound lane, with:

X-axis extending horizontally to the right (north-to-south direction).
Y-axis extending vertically upwards.
4. Corrected Trajectories
The trajectories now align with the specified path for V1.

V1's Trajectory (Car):

Starting Point: In the northbound lane at approximately 
(
10
,
2
)
(10,2).
Path: Drifts left across the centerline into the southbound lane.
Collision Point: Impact with V2 at approximately 
(
25
,

)
(25,6).
Trajectory Coordinates:

V2's Trajectory (Car):

Starting Point: In the southbound lane at approximately 
(
30
,
6
)
(30,6), traveling south.
Path: Attempts to steer right but collides with V1 in an offset frontal collision, then rotates counterclockwise and comes to rest partially on the west shoulder facing south-southeast.
Collision Point: Impact with V1 at approximately 
(
25
,
6
)
(25,6).
Trajectory Coordinates:
