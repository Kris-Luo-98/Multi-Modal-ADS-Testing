Road Network and Lane Setup
Lane Width: 4 meters, so each lane is 2 meters on either side of the lane center.
Coordinate Adjustments: Each vehicleâ€™s trajectory will stay 2 meters offset from the centerline to reflect correct lane usage.

Trajectories Based on Lane Position and Width
Vehicle 1 (V1) - Car
Approaching from the North (Southbound Lane):

Trajectory Points:
Starting at (20, 2) in the southbound lane.
Moving southward toward the center of the intersection at (15, 0).
Drifting further left and reaching the collision point at (10, -2).
V1 Trajectory: [(20, 2), (15, 0), (10, -2)]

Vehicle 2 (V2) - Car
Approaching from the South (Northbound Lane):

Trajectory Points:
Starting at (-5, -2) in the northbound lane.
Moving northward along the lane towards (5, -2).
Reaching the collision point at (10, -2).
V2 Trajectory: [(-5, -2), (5, -2), (10, -2)]
