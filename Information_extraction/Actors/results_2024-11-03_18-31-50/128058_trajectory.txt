Analysis and Output for Provided Crash Case
Based on the crash summary​, road network description, and the provided sketch:

1. Road Setup
Road Type: Two-lane, two-way rural road (one lane in each direction: eastbound and westbound).
Road Length: 50 meters.
Lane Width: 4 meters per lane.
Conditions: Daylight, snowing, and wet road surface.
2. Vehicle Identification
Vehicle 1 (V1): 1998 Ford Taurus, 4-door sedan (classified as Car).

Movement: Traveling west in the westbound lane, behind V3.
Collision Sequence:
After V2 crossed into the westbound lane and struck V3, V2 rotated further into V1's path.
V1 collided with the right side of V2.
After impact, V1 continued forward, veering right, and came to rest on the north shoulder facing west.
Vehicle 2 (V2): 2000 Chevrolet Cavalier, 4-door sedan (classified as Car).

Movement: Traveling east in the eastbound lane, but crossed left of center into the westbound lane.
Collision Sequence:
Struck the left side of V3 in the westbound lane, causing both vehicles to rotate counterclockwise.
Continued rotating and entered V1’s path, where V1 struck V2 on the right side.
Came to rest in the roadway, facing west.
Vehicle 3 (V3): 2005 Chevrolet Trailblazer, 4-door utility vehicle (classified as Car).

Movement: Traveling west in the westbound lane ahead of V1.
Collision Sequence:
Struck on the left side by V2 after V2 crossed into the westbound lane.
Rotated counterclockwise, crossed into the eastbound lane, and came to rest off the south shoulder facing south-southeast.
3. Coordinate System and Trajectory Mapping
The origin is set at the bottom-left of the westbound lane, with:

X-axis extending horizontally to the right (west-to-east direction).
Y-axis extending vertically upwards.
4. Estimated Trajectories (Pre-Collision Only)
The trajectories reflect only the movement leading up to the collisions.

V1's Trajectory (Car):

Starting Point: In the westbound lane at approximately 
(
10
,
2
)
(10,2), traveling behind V3.
Path: Continues straight in the westbound lane, colliding with V2 when V2 crosses further into its path.
Collision Point: Impact with V2 at approximately 
(
25
,
2
)
(25,2).

V2's Trajectory (Car):

Starting Point: In the eastbound lane at approximately 
(
40
,
6
)
(40,6), traveling east.
Path: Crosses the centerline into the westbound lane, colliding with V3, then rotating further into V1's path.
Collision Point with V1: At approximately 
(
25
,
2
)
(25,2).
Trajectory Coordinates:

(25,2).
V3's Trajectory (Car):

Starting Point: In the westbound lane at approximately 
(
20
,
2
)
(20,2), ahead of V1.
Path: Continues straight until struck by V2, which causes it to rotate counterclockwise, cross into the eastbound lanes, and exit the roadway.
Collision Point with V2: At approximately 
(
25
,
2
)
(25,2).
Trajectory Coordinates: 
(
