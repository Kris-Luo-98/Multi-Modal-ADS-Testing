Step 1: Road Structure and Coordinate System
Road Type: Curve, with V1 exiting a right curve while V2 and V3 approach from the opposite direction.
Lanes: Two lanes, one per direction (two-way rural road).
Coordinate System: Origin set at the bottom-left of the curve, with the X-axis extending horizontally to the right and the Y-axis vertically upward.
Step 2: Vehicle Identification and Types
Vehicle 1 (V1): 2003 Ford Taurus, identified as Car.
Vehicle 2 (V2): 2004 Saab 9-5, identified as Car.
Vehicle 3 (V3): 2004 Ford Freestar, now identified as Car in this format (though originally a minivan, it’s grouped under "Car" here for consistency).
Step 3: Analyzing the Crash Sketch and Summary for Trajectories
V1 (Car - Ford Taurus):

Trajectory:
Starting point: (5, 2) — Northbound lane, moving along the curve.
Drifts left to centerline: (15, 4).
Collision point with V2: (20, 6) — Front-to-front, offset-frontal impact.
Rotation and separation: Ends up back in the northbound lane at (25, 6), facing east.
Final collision with V3: (25, 4) — Left-rear corner struck by V3.
V2 (Car - Saab 9-5):

Trajectory:
Starting point: (35, 8) — Southbound lane, approaching the curve.
Avoidance maneuver: Attempts to steer right, reaching (25, 6).
Collision point: (20, 6) — Offset-frontal collision with V1.
V3 (Car - Ford Freestar):

Trajectory:
Starting point: (45, 10) — Southbound lane, traveling behind V2.
Collision with V1: (25, 4) — Strikes V1’s left-rear corner after V1 comes to rest.
Final position: (20, 2) — Moves slightly forward and to the side after the impact with V1.
