Analysis and Output for Provided Crash Case
Based on the crash summary​, road network description, and the provided sketch:

1. Road Setup
Road Type: Two-lane, two-way rural road (one lane in each direction: eastbound and westbound).
Road Length: 50 meters.
Lane Width: 4 meters per lane.
Grade: Positive (uphill) grade for V1 (westbound), negative (downhill) grade for V2 (eastbound).
Conditions: Daylight, clear weather, and dry road surface.
2. Vehicle Identification
Vehicle 1 (V1): 2004 Saturn Ion, 4-door sedan (classified as Car).

Movement: Traveling west in the westbound lane.
Collision Sequence:
Drifted left across the centerline, steered right to correct but ran off the road on the right side.
Over-corrected to the left, re-entering the road in a counterclockwise yaw, crossed the centerline, and was struck on the right side by V2.
Vehicle 2 (V2): 2005 Dodge Durango, 4-door utility vehicle (classified as Car).

Movement: Traveling east in the eastbound lane.
Collision Sequence: Attempted to avoid V1 by braking and steering right but was unable to avoid a collision, striking the right side of V1.
3. Coordinate System and Trajectory Mapping
The origin is set at the bottom-left of the westbound lane, with:

X-axis extending horizontally to the right (east-to-west direction).
Y-axis extending vertically upwards.
4. Estimated Trajectories (Pre-Collision Only)
The trajectories reflect only the movement leading up to the collision.

V1's Trajectory (Car):

Starting Point: In the westbound lane at approximately 
(

)
(10,2).
Path: Drifts left across the centerline, exits the road on the right side, over-corrects to the left, re-enters the road in a counterclockwise yaw, and crosses into V2’s lane.
Collision Point: Impact with V2 at approximately 
(
25

)
(25,6).

V2's Trajectory (Car):

Starting Point: In the eastbound lane at approximately 
(
40
,

)
(40,6), traveling east.
Path: Continues straight in the eastbound lane, braking and steering right to avoid V1, but collides with V1 at approximately 
(
