Based on the information from the crash summary, crash sketch, and road network, here’s the breakdown and analysis for this case:

Step 1: Road Structure and Coordinate System
Road Type: Curve, with V1 (eastbound) negotiating a left curve downhill and V2 (westbound) negotiating a right curve uphill.
Lanes: Two lanes, one per direction (two-way rural road).
Coordinate System: Origin set at the bottom-left of the curve, with the X-axis extending horizontally to the right and the Y-axis vertically upward.
Step 2: Vehicle Identification and Types
Vehicle 1 (V1): A 1997 Dodge Neon (Sedan), identified as Car.
Vehicle 2 (V2): A 1993 Plymouth Voyager (Minivan), identified as Car.
Step 3: Analyzing the Crash Sketch and Summary for Trajectories
V1 (Car - Dodge Neon):

Starting Position: Eastbound lane, approaching the left curve and moving downhill.
Collision Point: Full-frontal collision with V2, which crossed into V1’s lane.
Post-Collision Rotation: Rotated approximately 20 degrees clockwise and came to rest in or near its lane.
V2 (Car - Plymouth Voyager):

Starting Position: Westbound lane, approaching the right curve and moving uphill.
Collision Point: Crossed the centerline and collided frontally with V1 in V1’s lane.
Post-Collision Rotation: Rotated approximately 20 degrees counterclockwise and came to rest.
Step 4: Predicted Trajectories in 2D Coordinates
Using estimated positions based on the crash description, here is the trajectory for each vehicle:

V1 (Car - Dodge Neon)
Trajectory:
Starting point: (5, 2) (eastbound lane, entering the curve)
Mid-curve position: (15, 4)
Collision point: (20, 6)
Post-collision rest: (22, 6) (after a slight clockwise rotation)
V2 (Car - Plymouth Voyager)
Trajectory:
Starting point: (35, 8) (westbound lane, entering the curve from the opposite direction)
Mid-curve position: (25, 7) (moving across the centerline)
Collision point: (20, 6)
Post-collision rest: (18, 6) (after a slight counterclockwise rotation)
Final Output

{
  "V1_traj": [(5, 2), (15, 4), (20, 6), (22, 6)],
  "V1_type": "Car",
  "V2_traj": [(35, 8), (25, 7), (20, 6), (18, 6)],
  "V2_type": "Car",
  "Validation": "Passed"
}
