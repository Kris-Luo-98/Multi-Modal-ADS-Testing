Analysis and Output for Provided Crash Case
Based on the crash summaryâ€‹, road network description, and the provided sketch:

1. Road Setup
Road Type: Two-lane, two-way rural road (one lane in each direction: eastbound and westbound).
Road Length: 50 meters.
Lane Width: 4 meters per lane.
Conditions: Icy road surface, daylight, clear but windy weather.
2. Vehicle Identification
Vehicle 1 (V1): 2001 Ford Taurus, 4-door sedan (classified as Car).

Movement: Traveling east in the eastbound lane.
Collision Sequence: The driver of V1 was unable to avoid V2 as V2 lost control and crossed into the eastbound lane, resulting in a full-frontal collision with V2.
Vehicle 2 (V2): 1996 Jeep Grand Cherokee, 4-door utility vehicle (classified as Car).

Movement: Traveling west in the westbound lane.
Collision Sequence: Lost control on the icy surface, crossed the centerline, and collided with V1 in a full-frontal collision.
3. Coordinate System and Trajectory Mapping
The origin is set at the bottom-left of the eastbound lane, with:

X-axis extending horizontally to the right (east-to-west direction).
Y-axis extending vertically upwards.
4. Estimated Trajectories (Pre-Collision Only)
The trajectories are derived based on the vehicle movement descriptions and the sketch, assuming 1 unit = 1 meter, showing only waypoints leading up to the collision.

V1's Trajectory (Car):

Starting Point: In the eastbound lane at approximately 
(

)
(10,2).
Path: Continues eastward in the eastbound lane, colliding with V2 in a full-frontal configuration.
Collision Point: Impact with V2 at approximately 
(

2
)
(25,2).
Trajectory Coordinates:

V2's Trajectory (Car):

Starting Point: In the westbound lane at approximately 
(
40
,
6
)
(40,6), traveling west.
Path: Loses control on the icy surface, crosses into the eastbound lane, and collides with V1 in a full-frontal configuration.
Collision Point: Impact with V1 at approximately 
(
