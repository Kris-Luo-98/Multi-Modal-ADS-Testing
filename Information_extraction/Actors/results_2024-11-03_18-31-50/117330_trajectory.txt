Analysis and Output for the Crash Case
1. Road Setup
Road Type: Two-lane, two-way rural roadway (one lane in each direction: eastbound and westbound).
Road Length: 50 meters.
Lane Width: 4 meters per lane.
Conditions: Icy road surface, daylight, and cloudy weather.
2. Vehicle Identification
Vehicle 1 (V1): 2000 Chevrolet Blazer, 2-door utility vehicle (classified as Car).

Movement: Traveling east in the eastbound lane.
Collision Sequence: V2 lost control, crossed into V1's lane, and collided with the front of V1 in an offset-frontal configuration.
Vehicle 2 (V2): 2001 Honda Accord, 4-door sedan (classified as Car).

Movement: Traveling west in the westbound lane.
Collision Sequence: Lost control on the icy road, crossed the centerline, and collided with V1.
3. Coordinate System and Trajectory Mapping
The origin is set at the bottom-left of the eastbound lane, with:

X-axis extending horizontally to the right (east-to-west direction).
Y-axis extending vertically upwards.
4. Corrected Trajectories (Pre-Collision Only)
The trajectories now include only the waypoints leading up to the collision.

V1's Trajectory (Car):

Starting Point: In the eastbound lane at approximately 
(
10
,
2
)
(10,2).
Path: Continues eastward, colliding with V2 at approximately 
(
25
,
2
)
(25,2).
Trajectory Coordinates: 
(

(25,2).
V2's Trajectory (Car):

Starting Point: In the westbound lane at approximately 
(
40
,
6
)
(40,6), traveling west.
Path: Loses control, crosses into the eastbound lane, and collides with V1 at approximately 
(
25
,
2
)
(25,2).
Trajectory Coordinates: 
(
