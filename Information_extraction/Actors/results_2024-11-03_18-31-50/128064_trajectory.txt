Step 1: Construct Coordinate System
The scene is a standard four-leg intersection with two-lane roads intersecting at right angles. Each lane is 4 meters wide, giving a total width of 8 meters in each direction.

We set the origin of the coordinate system at the center of the intersection, with the X-axis extending horizontally (positive direction to the right) and the Y-axis vertically (positive direction upwards). This setup aligns the north-south and east-west lanes with the Y-axis and X-axis, respectively.

Step 2: Identify Vehicles and Initial Conditions
From the crash summary and revised output:

Vehicle 1 (V1) is a 2002 Ford Taurus (Car), traveling northbound in the northbound lane.
Vehicle 2 (V2), a 1998 Ford F150 (Truck), is actually classified as a Car (per the output) and is traveling eastbound in the eastbound lane.
Step 3: Determine Trajectories and Coordinates
From the sketch, summary, and revised output:

V1 is moving northbound in the left lane (aligned with X = 2).
V2 is moving eastbound in the center lane of its road (aligned with Y = -2).
The trajectories for both vehicles are derived from the new coordinate points provided:

V1 (Car):

Starting Position: (2, -10), indicating it is approaching the intersection from the south in the northbound lane.
Collision Point: At (2, 2), where it intersects with V2’s path.
V1 Trajectory Coordinates:

]
V1_traj=[(2,−10),(2,−5),(2,2)]
V2 (Car):

Starting Position: (-10, -2), indicating it is approaching the intersection from the west in the eastbound lane.
Collision Point: Near (2, -2), where it crosses paths with V1.
V2 Trajectory Coordinates:

]
V2_traj=[(−10,−2),(−5,−2),(0,−2),(5,−2)]
Step 4: Validation and Final Output
The revised trajectories align with the collision type and intersection layout described in the summary:

V1 travels northbound along the X-coordinate of 2.
V2 travels eastbound along the Y-coordinate of -2, and the two vehicles collide near the center of the intersection.
Final Output

{
  "V1_traj": [(2, -10), (2, -5), (2, 2)],
  "V1_type": "Car",
  "V2_traj": [(-10, -2), (-5, -2), (0, -2), (5, -2)],
  "V2_type": "Car",
  "Validation": "Passed"
}
