Step 1: Establishing the Coordinate System
For a T-intersection:

Place the origin (0, 0) at the center of the intersection.
The main road extends horizontally along the X-axis (east-west).
The branch road extends vertically along the Y-axis (north-south).
Each lane is 4 meters wide, as per the road network information.

Step 2: Identifying Vehicle Types and Initial Positions
From the crash summary and output details:

V1 is confirmed as a Car (2001 Chrysler Sebring) traveling in the branch road, initially moving eastbound (negative X-direction) toward the intersection and then turning left (northbound).
V2 is identified as a Car (previously thought to be a truck but identified here as a car based on the output) traveling southbound (negative Y-direction) on the main road through-lane.
Step 3: Mapping Trajectories
Vehicle 1 (V1) Trajectory
V1 starts in the branch road, traveling east toward the intersection.
Approximate trajectory:
Starting at (-2, -10), moving north-east along the branch road.
Intermediate points at (-2, -5), approaching the intersection.
Reaches the center of the intersection at (0, 0), where it begins its left turn.
Completes the turn and moves to (-5, 2), northbound in the intersection.
Vehicle 2 (V2) Trajectory
V2 starts on the main road, traveling southbound.
Approximate trajectory:
Starting at (-10, -2) and moving eastward on the main roadâ€™s southbound lane.
Intermediate point at (-5, -2), approaching the intersection.
Reaches the collision point at (0, -2), where it strikes the left side of V1.
Step 4: Revised Output
The output, with the new trajectory details, is as follows:
{
  "V1_traj": [(-2, -10), (-2, -5), (0, 0), (-5, 2)],
  "V1_type": "Car",
  "V2_traj": [(-10, -2), (-5, -2), (0, -2)],
  "V2_type": "Car",
  "Validation": "Passed"
}
