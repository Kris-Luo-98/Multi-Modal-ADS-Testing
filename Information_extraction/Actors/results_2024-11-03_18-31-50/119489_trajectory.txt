To extract the trajectories from the given information, follow these steps:

### Step 1: Coordinate System Setup
- **Road Type**: T-intersection.
- Set the origin at the center of the intersection, with roads extending along the coordinate axes.
- The X-axis extends horizontally, with the positive direction to the right.
- The Y-axis extends vertically, with the positive direction upwards.

### Step 2: Identify Vehicles
- **V1**: A 1999 Chevrolet Malibu, classified as a "Car".
- **V2**: A 2003 Saturn Ion, classified as a "Car".

### Step 3: Map Starting and Collision Points
- **V1 Starting Point**: At the mouth of the commercial driveway, facing west, approximately at (-5, 0).
- **Collision Point**: The center of the intersection, approximately at (0, 0).
- **V2 Starting Point**: Approaching from the south, along the northbound lane, approximately at (0, -20).

### Step 4: Estimate Trajectories
Using linear interpolation based on the starting and collision points:

- **V1 Trajectory**: 
  - Starting: (-5, 0)
  - Intermediate Points: (-4, 0), (-2, 0)
  - Collision: (0, 0)

- **V2 Trajectory**: 
  - Starting: (0, -20)
  - Intermediate Points: (0, -10), (0, -5)
  - Collision: (0, 0)

### Output

{
  'V1_traj': [(-5, 0), (-4, 0), (-2, 0), (0, 0)], 
  'V1_type': 'Car', 
  'V2_traj': [(0, -20), (0, -10), (0, -5), (0, 0)], 
  'V2_type': 'Car', 
  'Validation': 'Passed'
}
