Based on the crash summary, sketch, and road network details provided, here is the analysis and output for the case:

Step 1: Establishing the Coordinate System
For this merge scenario:

The origin (0, 0) is placed at the bottom-left of the main road, where the entrance ramp begins to merge onto the freeway.
The main road (freeway) extends horizontally along the X-axis (east-west) with three lanes westbound (left to right, positive X direction) and three lanes eastbound (negative X direction).
The entrance ramp (branch road) extends from the bottom-left corner, curving to merge into the right westbound lane of the main road.
Each lane width is approximately 5 meters.

Step 2: Identifying Vehicle Types and Initial Positions
From the crash summary and sketch:

V1 (1998 Jeep Cherokee Sport, utility vehicle) is identified as a Car and was traveling on the entrance ramp, attempting to merge into the right westbound lane of the freeway.
V2 (2000 Peterbilt tractor-trailer) is identified as a Truck traveling westbound in the right lane of the freeway, approaching the merge area.
Based on the sketch:

V1 is coming from the entrance ramp on a curved path, and it begins to lose control as it merges into the main road.
V2 continues westbound in the right lane and collides with the left side of V1 as V1 enters the lane.
Step 3: Mapping Trajectories
Vehicle 1 (V1) Trajectory
V1 starts on the entrance ramp, curving toward the merge area.
Approximate trajectory:
Starting at (-15, -10), on the entrance ramp.
Intermediate point at (-10, -5), approaching the merge area.
Reaches the right westbound lane at (0, 0), where it loses control and rotates counterclockwise.
Collision point at (5, 0), where V2 strikes the left side of V1.
Vehicle 2 (V2) Trajectory
V2 starts on the main road, traveling westbound in the right lane.
Approximate trajectory:
Starting at (-20, 0), moving straight in the right westbound lane.
Intermediate point at (-10, 0), continuing in the right lane.
Collision point at (5, 0), where it strikes V1.
Final Output
The output, based on the described trajectories, is as follows:

{
  "V1_traj": [(-15, -10), (-10, -5), (0, 0), (5, 0)],
  "V1_type": "Car",
  "V2_traj": [(-20, 0), (-10, 0), (5, 0)],
  "V2_type": "Truck",
  "Validation": "Passed"
}
