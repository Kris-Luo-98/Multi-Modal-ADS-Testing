Based on the updated output with revised trajectory coordinates, here’s an adjusted step-by-step analysis.

Step 1: Construct Coordinate System
The crash occurred at a four-leg intersection involving:

A three-lane, two-way road for V1 (eastbound through lane, eastbound left-turn lane, and westbound lane).
A three-lane, two-way intersecting road for V2 (northbound and southbound lanes).
Each lane width is 3.5 meters, so each three-lane section is approximately 10.5 meters wide.

The origin of the coordinate system is set at the center of the intersection. The X-axis extends horizontally (positive direction to the right), and the Y-axis extends vertically (positive upwards). This aligns the eastbound/westbound lanes along the X-axis and the northbound/southbound lanes along the Y-axis.

Step 2: Identify Vehicles and Initial Conditions
Based on the crash summary and the revised output:

Vehicle 1 (V1) is a 2001 Volvo V70 (Car), traveling eastbound in the through lane and entering the intersection.
Vehicle 2 (V2) is a 2002 Pontiac Aztec (Car), traveling southbound in the through lane of the intersecting road.
Step 3: Determine Trajectories and Coordinates
From the sketch, summary, and the revised output:

V1 is moving eastward, entering the intersection where it is struck on its left side by V2 in a T-type collision.
The impact redirects V1 slightly to the southeast, after which it exits the intersection and comes to rest.
V2 continues southward post-collision, coming to rest in the southbound lane after a slight southward deviation.
The coordinates provided in the output align with the intersection layout and the vehicle paths described:

V1 (Car):

Starting Position: Approaching the intersection from the west along the eastbound lane, aligned with a Y-coordinate of approximately -4.5.
Collision Point: Near the center of the intersection, where V2 impacts V1’s left side.
Post-Collision Path: Redirected to the southeast, exiting the intersection.

V1_traj=[(−10,−4.5),(−5,−4.5),(0,−4.5),(5,−5)]
V2 (Car):

Starting Position: Approaching the intersection from the north along the southbound lane, approximately aligned with X = -2.5.
Collision Point: Near the center of the intersection, colliding with V1 in a T-type configuration.
Post-Collision Path: Continues southward, coming to rest slightly south of the intersection.

Step 4: Validation and Final Output
The trajectories align with the crash summary and sketch details:

V1 travels eastbound, enters the intersection, and is struck on its left side by V2, resulting in a slight redirection towards the southeast.
V2 continues southward, slightly deviated after the impact, and comes to rest in the southbound lane.
