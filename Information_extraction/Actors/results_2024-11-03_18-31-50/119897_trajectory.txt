Analysis and Output for the Crash Case
1. Road Setup
Road Type: Four-lane, two-way road (two lanes in each direction: northbound and southbound).
Road Length: 50 meters.
Lane Width: 4 meters per lane.
Conditions: Icy road surface, dark, and sleeting weather.
2. Vehicle Identification
Vehicle 1 (V1): 2000 GMC Sonoma, 3-door extended cab pickup truck (classified as Car).

Movement: Traveling north in the left northbound lane.
Collision Sequence:
Lost control on the icy surface, rotating counterclockwise and crossing the centerline into the southbound lanes.
Collided with V2 in a T-type configuration.
Vehicle 2 (V2): 2001 Buick Regal, 4-door sedan (classified as Car).

Movement: Traveling south in the right southbound lane.
Collision Sequence: Approaching V1, unable to avoid a collision, resulting in a T-type impact with V1.
3. Coordinate System and Trajectory Mapping
The origin is set at the bottom-left of the northbound lanes, with:

X-axis extending horizontally to the right (north-to-south direction).
Y-axis extending vertically upwards.
4. Corrected Trajectories
The trajectories now reflect the specified paths for V1 and V2.

V1's Trajectory (Car):

Starting Point: In the left northbound lane at approximately 
(

)
(5,6).
Path: Loses control, rotates counterclockwise, crosses the centerline into the southbound lanes, and collides with V2.
Collision Point: Impact with V2 at approximately 
(

)
(25,14).

V2's Trajectory (Car):

Starting Point: In the right southbound lane at approximately 
(

(40,14), traveling south.
Path: Continues straight in the right southbound lane, colliding with V1 at approximately 
(
