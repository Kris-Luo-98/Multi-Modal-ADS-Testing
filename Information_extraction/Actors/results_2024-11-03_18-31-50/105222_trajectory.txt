Analysis and Output for the Crash Case
1. Road Setup
Road Type: Straight, four-lane urban roadway (two lanes for each direction: northbound and southbound).
Road Length: 50 meters.
Lane Width: 4 meters per lane.
2. Vehicle Identification
Vehicle 1 (V1): 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee, 4-door utility vehicle (classified as Car).

Movement: Traveling north in the left northbound lane. Swerved left to avoid stopped or slowing traffic, crossing into the left southbound lane.
Collision: Front of V1 struck the front of V2 in an offset collision in the left southbound lane.
Vehicle 2 (V2): 1996 Ford Contour, 4-door sedan (classified as Car).

Movement: Traveling south in the left southbound lane.
Collision: Front of V2 struck by the front of V1 in an offset collision.
3. Coordinate System and Trajectory Mapping
The origin is set at the bottom-left of the northbound lanes, with:

X-axis extending horizontally to the right (north-to-south direction).
Y-axis extending vertically upwards.
4. Updated Trajectories
The trajectories now reflect the specified paths.

V1's Trajectory (Car):

Starting Point: In the left northbound lane at approximately 
(

(5,6).
Path: Continues north, then swerves left across to the left southbound lane.
Collision Point: Impact with V2 at approximately
