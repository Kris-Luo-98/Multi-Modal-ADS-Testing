Based on the revised output with updated trajectory coordinates, here’s an adjusted step-by-step analysis.

Step 1: Construct Coordinate System
The crash took place at a four-leg intersection involving:

A two-lane, two-way rural road for V1 (southbound and northbound lanes).
A two-lane, two-way rural road for V2 (eastbound and westbound lanes).
Each lane is 4 meters wide, making each two-lane road approximately 8 meters wide. We set the origin of the coordinate system at the center of the intersection, with the X-axis extending horizontally (positive to the right) and the Y-axis extending vertically (positive upwards). This orientation aligns the southbound and eastbound lanes with the Y-axis and X-axis, respectively.

Step 2: Identify Vehicles and Initial Conditions
Based on the crash summary and the revised output:

Vehicle 1 (V1) is a 1993 Ford Taurus (Car), traveling southbound in the left lane of its roadway, approaching the intersection.
Vehicle 2 (V2) is a 1992 Chevrolet Caprice (Car), traveling eastbound in the left lane of the intersecting roadway.
Step 3: Determine Trajectories and Coordinates
From the summary and sketch, the crash scenario involves:

V1 and V2 entering the intersection at the same time, leading to an L-type collision where the front of V1 strikes the left side of V2.
After the initial impact, both vehicles are redirected, with V1 continuing straight through the intersection and V2 shifting slightly as it moves across the intersection.
Using the intersection layout and revised paths, the trajectory coordinates are as follows:

V1 (Car):

Starting Position: Southbound lane approaching the intersection, approximately aligned with an X-coordinate of -2.5.
Collision Point: Near the center of the intersection where it strikes the left side of V2.
Post-Collision Path: Continues moving south after the impact.
V1 Trajectory Coordinates:

V1_traj=[(−2.5,10),(−2.5,5),(−2.5,0)]
V2 (Car):

Starting Position: Eastbound lane approaching the intersection, aligned with a Y-coordinate of -2.5.
Collision Point: Near the center of the intersection where V1 impacts its left side.
Post-Collision Path: Continues moving eastward through the intersection, with a slight shift before coming to rest.
V2 Trajectory Coordinates:

V2_traj=[(−10,−2.5),(−5,−2.5),(0,−2.5),(3,−2.5)]
Step 4: Validation and Final Output
The updated trajectories are consistent with the crash description and sketch details:

V1 travels southbound, enters the intersection, and collides with V2 in an L-type configuration, causing V1 to continue slightly southward.
V2 continues eastward through the intersection post-collision, following a straight path.
Final Output

  "V1_traj": [(-2.5, 10), (-2.5, 5), (-2.5, 0)],
  "V1_type": "Car",
  "V2_traj": [(-10, -2.5), (-5, -2.5), (0, -2.5), (3, -2.5)],
