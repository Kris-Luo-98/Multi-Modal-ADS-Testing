Step 1: Construct Coordinate System
The scene remains the same: a four-leg intersection with five lanes in total, where each lane is 3.5 meters wide, giving a total intersection width of 17.5 meters for the five-lane area.

We place the origin of the coordinate system at the center of the intersection. The X-axis extends horizontally (positive to the right), and the Y-axis extends vertically (positive direction upwards). This setup aligns the southbound and northbound lanes on the Y-axis, with left and right turns (east/west) aligned on the X-axis.

Step 2: Identify Vehicles and Initial Conditions
From the summary and the adjusted output:

Vehicle 1 (V1) is identified as a 2001 Chrysler Sebring (Car), moving southbound in the leftmost lane of the intersection.
Vehicle 2 (V2), previously thought to be a truck, is actually another Car, a 2000 Chevrolet Venture (classified as a car-type minivan). It is moving northbound in the center turn lane and intends to turn left across V1’s path.
Step 3: Determine Trajectories and Coordinates
From the revised output:

V1: The trajectory moves in a straight line down the Y-axis from north to south, remaining in the leftmost lane (indicated by the X-coordinate -2).
V2: Initially travels north in the center lane (aligned with an X-coordinate of 2), then turns left as it enters the intersection, moving westward and ending with an X-coordinate of -5.
Using the intersection origin and the observed vehicle paths, the revised trajectory details are:

V1 (Car):

Starting Position: (-2, 20), representing the leftmost southbound lane.
Movement: Continues straight southward through the intersection without changing its lane position.
Collision Point: (-2, 0), where V2's turn intersects with V1’s straight path.
V1 Trajectory Coordinates:

]
V1_traj=[(−2,20),(−2,10),(−2,0)]
V2 (Car):

Starting Position: (2, -20), representing the center northbound lane.
Movement: Moves north along the center lane, then turns left within the intersection, ending up in the westward direction.
Collision Point: The collision occurs at approximately (2, 0), as V2 is making its left turn across V1’s path. V2 continues slightly westward, represented by the final point (-5, 2).
V2 Trajectory Coordinates:

V2_traj=[(2,−20),(2,−10),(2,0),(−5,2)]
Step 4: Validation and Final Output
The trajectories are consistent with the crash summary and updated information:

V1 is moving southbound in a straight line within the left lane.
V2 is turning left across the intersection, starting in the center lane, and colliding with V1's path as it turns westward.
Final Output

{
  "V1_traj": [(-2, 20), (-2, 10), (-2, 0)],
  "V1_type": "Car",
  "V2_traj": [(2, -20), (2, -10), (2, 0), (-5, 2)],
  "V2_type": "Car",
  "Validation": "Passed"
