Analysis and Output for the Crash Case
1. Road Setup
Road Type: Straight, four-lane divided freeway with an unprotected median (two lanes for each direction: southbound and northbound).
Road Length: 50 meters.
Lane Width: 4 meters per lane.
2. Vehicle Identification
Vehicle 1 (V1): 2002 Pontiac Aztek, 4-door utility vehicle (classified as Car).
Movement: Traveling south in the right southbound lane, approaching V2.
Collision: Front of V1 struck the rear of V2's trailer.
Vehicle 2 (V2): 2000 Chevrolet K3500, crew cab pickup pulling a three-axle auto transport trailer (classified as Truck).
Movement: Traveling south in the right southbound lane, ahead of V1 and moving slower due to traffic congestion.
Collision: Rear of V2's trailer was struck by the front of V1.
3. Coordinate System and Trajectory Mapping
The origin is set at the bottom-left of the southbound lanes, with:

X-axis extending horizontally to the right (south-to-north direction).
Y-axis extending vertically upwards.
4. Corrected Trajectories
The trajectories are now aligned with the specified paths.

V1's Trajectory (Car):

Starting Point: In the right southbound lane at approximately 
(
10
,

)
(10,2).
Path: Continues north, following V2 in the same lane, and collides with the rear of V2â€™s trailer at approximately 
(
25

)
(25,2).
Trajectory Coordinates:
