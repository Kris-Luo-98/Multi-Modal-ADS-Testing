Analysis and Output for Provided Crash Case
Based on the crash summary​, road network description, and the provided sketch:

1. Road Setup
Road Type: Two-lane, two-way rural road (one lane in each direction: eastbound and westbound).
Road Length: 50 meters.
Lane Width: 4 meters per lane.
Conditions: Daylight, cloudy weather, and a dry road surface.
2. Vehicle Identification
Vehicle 1 (V1): 2002 Volkswagen New Beetle, 2-door hatchback (classified as Car).

Movement: Traveling west in the westbound lane.
Collision Sequence: V1 attempted to avoid V2 but was unable to do so. V2 struck V1 in an offset-frontal collision.
Post-Collision Position: After impact, V1 rotated counterclockwise approximately 170 degrees, coming to rest off the north edge of the road facing east-southeast.
Vehicle 2 (V2): 1995 Chevrolet Monte Carlo, 2-door coupe (classified as Car).

Movement: Traveling east in the eastbound lane; the driver reportedly fell asleep, causing the vehicle to drift left across the centerline into V1’s path.
Collision Sequence: Front of V2 struck the front of V1 in an offset-frontal mode.
Post-Collision Position: Rotated counterclockwise approximately 40 degrees, coming to rest in the westbound lane facing north-northeast.
3. Coordinate System and Trajectory Mapping
The origin is set at the bottom-left of the westbound lane, with:

X-axis extending horizontally to the right (east-to-west direction).
Y-axis extending vertically upwards.
4. Estimated Trajectories (Pre-Collision Only)
The trajectories reflect only the movement leading up to the collision, as final rest positions are off the road.

V1's Trajectory (Car):

Starting Point: In the westbound lane at approximately

Path: Continues straight in the westbound lane, colliding with V2 after V2 crosses into its lane.
Collision Point: Impact with V2 at approximately

)
(25,2).
