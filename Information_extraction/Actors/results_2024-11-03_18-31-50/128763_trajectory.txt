Analysis and Output for the Crash Case
1. Road Setup
Road Type: Two-lane, two-way rural road (one lane in each direction: eastbound and westbound).
Road Length: 100 meters.
Lane Width: 4 meters per lane.
Conditions: Daylight, raining, with a wet road surface.
2. Vehicle Identification
Vehicle 1 (V1): 2006 Chevrolet Malibu, 4-door sedan (classified as Car).

Movement: Traveling west in the westbound lane.
Collision Sequence: V1 attempted to brake but was unable to avoid V2, which had crossed into its path after hydroplaning.
Impact: Front of V1 struck the rear of V2.
Post-Collision Position: V1 was redirected northwest, departing the road and coming to rest off the roadway facing north-northwest.
Vehicle 2 (V2): 1993 Jeep Wrangler, utility vehicle (classified as Car).

Movement: Traveling east in the eastbound lane, hydroplaned upon hitting a standing puddle, and lost control.
Collision Sequence: Rotated counterclockwise, crossed the centerline, and entered the westbound lane backward.
Impact: Rear of V2 was struck by the front of V1.
Post-Collision Position: Pushed forward to the west, came to rest in the middle of the road facing south-southwest.
3. Coordinate System and Trajectory Mapping
The origin is set at the bottom-left of the westbound lane, with:

X-axis extending horizontally to the right (east-to-west direction).
Y-axis extending vertically upwards.
4. Corrected Trajectories (Pre-Collision Only)
The trajectory for V1 is now updated to reflect the specified path.

V1's Trajectory (Car):

Starting Point: In the westbound lane at approximately 
(
10
,
2
)
(10,2).
Path: Continues straight, veering slightly upwards as it approaches V2, resulting in a frontal collision with V2â€™s rear.
Collision Point: Impact with V2 at approximately 
(
50
,
6
)
(50,6).
Trajectory Coordinates:

(50,6).
V2's Trajectory (Car):

Starting Point: In the eastbound lane at approximately 
(
90
,
6
)
(90,6), traveling east.
Path: Hits a puddle, hydroplanes, rotates counterclockwise, and crosses into the westbound lane backward.
Collision Point: Impact with V1 at approximately 
(
50
,
6
)
(50,6).
Trajectory Coordinates:
