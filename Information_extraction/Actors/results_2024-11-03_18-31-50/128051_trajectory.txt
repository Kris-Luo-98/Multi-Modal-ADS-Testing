Analysis and Output for the Crash Case
1. Road Setup
Road Type: Four-lane, two-way road (two lanes in each direction with a centerline).
Road Length: 50 meters.
Lane Width: 4 meters per lane.
Conditions: Daylight, clear weather, and a dry road surface.
2. Vehicle Identification
Vehicle 1 (V1): 1999 Dodge Durango, 4-door utility vehicle (classified as Car).

Movement: Traveling north in the left northbound lane.
Collision Sequence: V2, after being struck from behind by V3, crossed into the northbound lane, colliding with V1 in an offset frontal collision.
Vehicle 2 (V2): 1999 Mercury Villager, minivan (classified as Car).

Movement: Traveling south in the left southbound lane, decelerating.
Collision Sequence: Rear-ended by V3, causing V2 to veer left, cross the centerline, and collide with V1 in the northbound lane.
Vehicle 3 (V3): 2004 Jeep Liberty, 4-door utility vehicle (classified as Car).

Movement: Traveling south in the left southbound lane behind V2.
Collision Sequence: Did not notice V2 decelerating, resulting in a rear-end collision with V2.
3. Coordinate System and Trajectory Mapping
The origin is set at the bottom-left of the northbound lanes, with:

X-axis extending horizontally to the right (north-to-south direction).
Y-axis extending vertically upwards.
4. Corrected Trajectories
The trajectories are now aligned with the specified paths for V2 and V3.

V1's Trajectory (Car):

Starting Point: In the left northbound lane at approximately

V2's Trajectory (Car):

Starting Point: In the left southbound lane at approximately 
(
40

10
)
(40,10).
Path: Decelerating, then struck by V3 from behind, causing V2 to veer left, cross the centerline, and collide with V1 in the northbound lane.
Collision Point: Impact with V1 at approximately 
(

(25,6).
V3's Trajectory (Car):

Starting Point: In the left southbound lane at approximately 
(
45
,
10
)
(45,10).
Path: Approaches V2 from behind and collides with the rear of V2 at approximately 
(
40
,

)
(40,10).
Trajectory Coordinates: 
(
