Analysis and Output for Provided Crash Case
Based on the crash summaryâ€‹, road network description, and the provided sketch:

1. Road Setup
Road Type: Four-lane, two-way road with a center turn lane (two lanes in each direction: westbound and eastbound).
Road Length: 50 meters.
Lane Width: 4 meters per lane.
2. Vehicle Identification
Vehicle 1 (V1): 2000 Jeep Cherokee, 4-door utility vehicle (classified as Car).

Movement: Traveling west in the right westbound lane when the driver experienced a syncopal episode, possibly due to a blood sugar imbalance.
Collision Sequence:
Drifted to the left, crossing the center turn lane.
Entered the eastbound lane and collided with V2 in an offset frontal collision.
Vehicle 2 (V2): 1997 Pontiac Grand Prix, 2-door coupe (classified as Car).

Movement: Traveling east in the eastbound lane.
Collision: Front of V2 struck by the front of V1 in an offset frontal collision.
3. Coordinate System and Trajectory Mapping
The origin is set at the bottom-left of the westbound lanes, with:

X-axis extending horizontally to the right (west-to-east direction).
Y-axis extending vertically upwards.
4. Estimated Trajectories
The trajectories are derived from the vehicle movement descriptions and sketch, assuming 1 unit = 1 meter.

V1's Trajectory (Car):

Starting Point: In the right westbound lane at approximately
