To solve this case, let's follow the structured approach:

### Step 1: Construct the Coordinate System

- **Road Type**: Merge
- **Coordinate System**: Place the origin at the far-left bottom of the main road. The X-axis extends horizontally to the right, and the Y-axis extends vertically upwards.

### Step 2: Identify Vehicles

- **V1**: Car (2002 Honda Accord)
- **V2**: Truck (2006 Freightliner tractor-trailer)

### Step 3: Map Starting and Collision Points

1. **V1** enters the curve on the entrance ramp and merges onto the main road.
2. **V2** travels in the right eastbound lane.

- **Starting Position (V1)**: Approaching from the bottom-left, entering the merge at (approximate coordinate choice for visual alignment).
- **Collision Point (V1 and V2)**: Line up where V1 merges into V2's lane.

### Step 4: Predict and Verify Trajectories

Using the sketch and summary, frame plausible trajectories.

#### Predicted Trajectories:

- **V1_traj**: Entering from the merge and clashing with V2.
  - Start: (5, 0)
  - Path through merging and collision: [(5, 0), (8, 1), (12, 3), (15, 6)]

- **V2_traj**: Continuing down the eastbound lane.
  - Start: (12, 5)
  - Path maintaining lane and collision: [(12, 5), (15, 6), (20, 6)]

### Output:

{
    'V1_traj': [(5, 0), (8, 1), (12, 3), (15, 6)], 
    'V1_type': 'Car', 
    'V2_traj': [(12, 5), (15, 6), (20, 6)], 
    'V2_type': 'Truck', 
    'Validation': 'Passed'
}
