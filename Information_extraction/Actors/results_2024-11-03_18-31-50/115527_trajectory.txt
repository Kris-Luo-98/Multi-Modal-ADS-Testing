Road Network and Lane Setup
Lane Width: 3.5 meters per lane.
This positions each vehicle 2 meters offset from the centerline, placing them within their respective lanes as they approach the intersection.
Revised Trajectories Based on Lane Position and Width
Vehicle 1 (V1) - Sedan
Approaching from the South (Northbound Left Lane):

Trajectory Points:
Starting at (2, -20) in the northbound left lane.
Approaching the intersection at (2, -10).
Collision at the center of the intersection at (0, 0).
Final resting position at approximately (-3, 5) after the impact.
V1 Trajectory: [(2, -20), (2, -10), (0, 0), (-3, 5)]

Vehicle 2 (V2) - Minivan
Approaching from the West (Westbound Left Lane):

Trajectory Points:
Starting at (-20, -2) in the westbound left lane.
Moving toward the intersection at (-10, -2).
Collision at the center of the intersection at (0, 0).
Final resting position at approximately (5, -2).
V2 Trajectory: [(-20, -2), (-10, -2), (0, 0), (5, -2)]

Final Output

{
  "V1_traj": [(2, -20), (2, -10), (0, 0), (-3, 5)],

  "V2_traj": [(-20, -2), (-10, -2), (0, 0), (5, -2)],
  "V2_type": "Car",
  "Validation": "Passed"
}
