Analysis and Output for the Crash Case
1. Road Setup
Road Type: Two-lane, two-way rural roadway (one lane in each direction: northbound and southbound).
Road Length: 50 meters.
Lane Width: 4 meters per lane.
2. Vehicle Identification
Vehicle 1 (V1): 1999 Chevrolet S10, 2-door pickup truck (classified as Car).

Movement: Traveling north in the northbound lane. Driver reportedly fell asleep, causing V1 to drift left across the centerline into the southbound lane.
Collision Sequence:
Drifted into the southbound lane.
First impact: Front of V1 struck the left side of V2â€™s power unit, causing V1 to rotate counterclockwise along V2's side.
Separation from V2: After impact, V1 continued off the right side of the road, coming to rest in a ditch facing northeast.
Vehicle 2 (V2): Tractor-trailer of unknown make/model (classified as Truck).

Movement: Traveling south in the southbound lane.
Collision Sequence:
Impacted by V1 on the left side of the power unit, causing a fuel tank rupture.
Fire: Fuel tank rupture led to a fire.
Post-collision: V2 departed the roadway to the right, ultimately colliding with a tree.
3. Coordinate System and Trajectory Mapping
The origin is set at the bottom-left of the northbound lane, with:

X-axis extending horizontally to the right (north-to-south direction).
Y-axis extending vertically upwards.
4. Corrected Trajectories
The trajectories are now aligned with the specified path for V2.

V1's Trajectory (Car):

Starting Point: In the northbound lane at approximately 
(
10
,
2
)
(10,2).
Path: Drifts left across the centerline into the southbound lane, collides with V2, rotates counterclockwise along V2, then exits the roadway to the right, ending in a ditch.
Collision Point: Impact with V2 at approximately 
(
20
,
4
)
(20,4).

V2's Trajectory (Truck):

Starting Point: In the southbound lane at approximately 
(
45
,
6
)
(45,6).
Path: Continues south in the southbound lane, colliding with V1 at approximately 
(
20
,

)
(20,4) and then moving off the road after the impact.
