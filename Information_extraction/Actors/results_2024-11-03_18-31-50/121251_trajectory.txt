Analysis Process
Step 1: Road Network and Coordinate System Setup
Road Type: Intersection (4-leg).
Lane Configuration: Two-lane, two-way rural road (one lane in each direction).
Lane Width: 4 meters.
Coordinate System: Place the origin at the center of the intersection, with the X-axis extending horizontally (east-west direction) and the Y-axis extending vertically (north-south direction).
Step 2: Identifying Vehicle Information
Vehicle 1 (V1):
Type: Car (2003 Chevrolet G20).
Initial Direction: Northbound in the northbound lane.
Path: Moving straight through the intersection.
Vehicle 2 (V2):
Type: Car (1992 Ford F150).
Initial Direction: Eastbound in the eastbound lane.
Path: Moving straight through the intersection.
Step 3: Determine Starting Points, Collision Points, and Final Positions
Using the specified output:

V1 Trajectory:

Starting Point: (2, -25), representing V1’s initial approach in the northbound lane.
Intermediate Points: Moves along the Y-axis at intervals: (2, -20), (2, -10), (2, 0).
Collision Point: At the intersection center (2, 0).
Final Position: (2, 10), indicating V1 continued north after the collision.
V2 Trajectory:

Starting Point: (-25, -2), representing V2’s initial approach in the eastbound lane.
Intermediate Points: Moves along the X-axis at intervals: (-10, -2), (-5, -2), (0, -2).
Collision Point: At the intersection center (0, -2).
Final Position: (5, -2), indicating V2 continued east after the collision.
Step 4: Analysis of the Collision Dynamics
Collision Configuration: The collision occurred near the center of the intersection, where the front of V2 (moving east) struck the left side of V1 (moving north) in an L-type configuration.
Post-Collision Trajectories:
Both vehicles appear to have continued along their original paths after the collision, without significant rotational displacement, coming to rest at points along their respective lanes.
Final Resting Positions:
V1 came to rest further north along the Y-axis at (2, 10).
V2 came to rest further east along the X-axis at (5, -2).
Step 5: Validation
Validation Check: Confirmed that both trajectories maintain correct lane positions and match the provided data.
