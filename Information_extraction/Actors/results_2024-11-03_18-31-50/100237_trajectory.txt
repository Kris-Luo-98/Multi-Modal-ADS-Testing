Road Network and Coordinate Setup
Road Type: Intersection (4-leg)
Coordinate System: Origin at the center of the intersection.
Lane Width: 4 meters.
This places vehicles within a 2-meter offset from the centerline of each road to align with the right-lane travel direction.
Adjusted Trajectories
Vehicle 1 (V1) - Car
Approaching from the West (traveling east in the right lane):

Trajectory Points:
Starting near the western edge of the map at (-15, -2).
Moving towards the center of the intersection at (-10, -2), (-5, -2).
Reaching the collision point at the intersection center (0, 0).
V1 Trajectory: [(-15, -2), (-10, -2), (-5, -2), (0, 0)]

Vehicle 2 (V2) - Car
Approaching from the South (traveling north in the right lane):

Trajectory Points:
Starting near the southern edge of the map at (2, -15).
Moving towards the center of the intersection at (2, -10), (2, -5).
Reaching the collision point at the intersection center (0, 0).
V2 Trajectory: [(2, -15), (2, -10), (2, -5), (0, 0)]
