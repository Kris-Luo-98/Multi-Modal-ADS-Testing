Analysis Process
Step 1: Road Network and Coordinate System Setup
Road Type: Intersection (4-leg).
Lane Configuration: Two-lane, two-way rural road (one lane in each direction).
Lane Width: 4 meters per lane.
Coordinate System: Set the origin at the center of the intersection, with the X-axis extending horizontally (east-west) and the Y-axis vertically (north-south).
Step 2: Identifying Vehicle Information
Vehicle 1 (V1):
Type: Car (2000 Dodge Dakota).
Initial Direction: Approaching the intersection from the east in the eastbound lane.
Path: Moving straight through the intersection.
Vehicle 2 (V2):
Type: Car (2006 Saturn Ion).
Initial Direction: Approaching the intersection from the west in the westbound lane.
Path: Moving straight through the intersection.
Step 3: Determine Starting Points, Collision Point, and Final Positions
Based on the provided output:

V1 Trajectory:

Starting Point: (20, 2), approaching the intersection in the eastbound lane.
Intermediate Points: Moving westward through (10, 2) and (5, 1).
Collision Point: Near the center of the intersection at (-2, -5).
Final Position: After the collision, V1 continues slightly southwestward, coming to rest at (-2, -5).
V2 Trajectory:

Starting Point: (-20, -2), approaching the intersection in the westbound lane.
Intermediate Points: Moving eastward through (-10, -2) and reaching the center of the intersection at (0, 0).
Collision Point: Near the center of the intersection.
Final Position: V2 continues slightly northeastward after the collision, coming to rest at (2, 5).
Step 4: Analysis of the Collision Dynamics
Collision Configuration: The collision occurred near the center of the intersection, where the front of V2 struck the left side of V1 in an L-type configuration.
Post-Collision Dynamics:
V1 was redirected slightly to the southwest after the collision, coming to a stop at (-2, -5).
V2 moved slightly northeast after the collision, coming to rest at (2, 5).
Vehicle Orientation: No significant rotation or redirection outside the intersection area was noted in the output.
Step 5: Validation
Validation Check: Confirmed that both trajectories align with the provided data, maintaining correct lane positions before and after the collision.
