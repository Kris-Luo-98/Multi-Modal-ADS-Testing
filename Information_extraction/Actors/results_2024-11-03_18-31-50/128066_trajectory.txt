Step 1: Construct Coordinate System
The crash occurred at a four-leg intersection involving:

A three-lane, two-way road (V1's approach).
A four-lane, two-way road (V2's approach).
Each lane width is 3.5 meters, so the three-lane road is approximately 10.5 meters wide, while the four-lane road is about 14 meters wide.

The origin of the coordinate system is set at the center of the intersection. The X-axis extends horizontally (positive direction to the right), and the Y-axis extends vertically (positive upwards). This aligns the southbound and westbound lanes along the Y-axis and X-axis, respectively.

Step 2: Identify Vehicles and Initial Conditions
From the summary and the revised output:

Vehicle 1 (V1) is a 2005 Nissan Altima (Car), traveling southbound in the leftmost lane with the intent to turn left (eastbound).
Vehicle 2 (V2) is a 2001 Ford Explorer Sport Trac (Truck), but classified as a Car based on the output, traveling westbound in the rightmost lane of a four-lane road.
Step 3: Determine Trajectories and Coordinates
Based on the sketch, summary, and revised output:

V1 travels southbound in the left lane, begins a left turn at the intersection, and collides with V2 approaching from the westbound direction.
V2 moves eastbound, and a T-type collision occurs at the center of the intersection as V2 collides with the left side of V1.
The trajectories provided in the output are as follows:

V1 (Car):

Starting Position: Near the left southbound lane, approximately aligned with X = -1.5.
Turning Movement: Moves south along X = -1.5, then starts turning left in the intersection.
Collision Point: Near (0, -3.5) where V2 strikes V1's left side.

]
V1_traj=[(−1.5,10),(−1.5,0),(−1.5,−3.5)]
V2 (Car):

Starting Position: Approaching from the westbound direction with an initial Y-coordinate of approximately 4.5.
Movement: Moves eastward along Y = 4.5 and reaches the center of the intersection.
Collision and Post-Collision Path: After the impact with V1, V2’s trajectory shifts toward the southwest corner, ending around (-3, -5).

V2_traj=[(10,4.5),(5,4.5),(0,4.5),(−3,−5)]
Step 4: Validation and Final Output
The revised trajectories align with the collision type and intersection layout described in the crash summary:

V1 follows a straight southward path, then initiates a left turn near the intersection center, where V2 collides with its left side.
V2 moves eastward and collides with V1 in a T-type configuration, then both vehicles are redirected to the southwest area post-collision.
Final Output

{
  "V1_traj": [(-1.5, 10), (-1.5, 0), (-1.5, -3.5)],
  "V1_type": "Car",
  "V2_traj": [(10, 4.5), (5, 4.5), (0, 4.5), (-3, -5)],
