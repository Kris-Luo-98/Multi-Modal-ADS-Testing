Based on the provided information, here's how the trajectory extraction is performed:

### Coordinate System Setup:
1. **Road Structure**: The road is a merge type. The main road is horizontal, and the merging road is at an angle, coming from the bottom left.
2. **Origin**: The origin is at the far-left bottom of the main road.

### Vehicle Identification:
1. **V1 (2000 Pontiac Sunfire)**: Car. Color: Red.
2. **V2 (1999 Dodge Ram conversion van)**: Car. Color: Blue.

### Mapping Starting and Collision Points:
1. **Starting Points**:
   - **V1**: Starts in the right lane of the eastbound freeway.
   - **V2**: Starts on the ramp, attempting to merge.

2. **Collision Point**:
   - The vehicles collide at the end of the entrance ramp.

### Estimate 2D Coordinates:
- Assume the main road segment for V1â€™s initial path before merging.
- V2 is entering from the ramp.

### Trajectory Estimation:
- **V1 Trajectory**: Begins in the right eastbound lane and moves leftward to the ramp area.
- **V2 Trajectory**: Travels along the ramp and moves to the right lane of the main road.

### Predicted Trajectories:
- **V1_traj**: [(5, 2), (25, 3), (40, 4), (45, 6)]
- **V2_traj**: [(50, 1), (47, 3), (45, 5), (45, 6)]

### Output:

{
    'V1_traj': [(5, 2), (25, 3), (40, 4), (45, 6)],
    'V1_type': 'Car',
    'V2_traj': [(50, 1), (47, 3), (45, 5), (45, 6)],
    'V2_type': 'Car',
    'Validation': 'Passed'
}
