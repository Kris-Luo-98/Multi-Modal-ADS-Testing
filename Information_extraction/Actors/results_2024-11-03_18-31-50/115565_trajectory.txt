Road Network and Coordinate Setup
Road Type: Intersection (4-leg).
Lane Configuration: Two-lane, two-way road in each direction.
Lane Width: 4 meters per lane.
Coordinate System: Origin is at the center of the intersection, with the X-axis extending horizontally and the Y-axis vertically.
Vehicle and Collision Information
V1: 1997 Ford Explorer (SUV), traveling west and attempting a left turn at the intersection.
V2: 2005 Chevrolet Trailblazer (SUV), traveling north, attempting to brake and steer left to avoid V1.
Collision Point: Near the center of the intersection, with an initial impact between the front of V2 and the left side of V1 in an L-type configuration. V1 then rotated clockwise, causing a sideslap between V1’s left rear and V2’s right side.
Final Resting Positions:
V1: Came to rest facing north in the southbound lane.
V2: Came to rest off the northwest corner of the intersection, facing north-northwest.

Adjusted Trajectories Based on Specified Coordinates
Vehicle 1 (V1) - SUV
Approaching from the East (Westbound Lane):

Trajectory Points:
Starting at (15, 2) in the westbound lane.
Moving toward the intersection at (10, 2).
Beginning the left turn at (5, 1).
