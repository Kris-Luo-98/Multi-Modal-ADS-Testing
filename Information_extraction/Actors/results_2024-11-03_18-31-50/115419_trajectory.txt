Road Network and Coordinate Setup
Road Type: Intersection (4-leg).
Lane Width: 4 meters per lane.
Coordinate System: Origin at the center of the intersection, with the X-axis extending horizontally and the Y-axis vertically.
Vehicle and Collision Information
V1: 1999 Ford Ranger (Pickup), traveling east on a two-lane, two-way dirt road, then entering the intersection from the east and attempting a left (northbound) turn.
V2: 1999 Dodge Durango (Utility Vehicle), traveling south in the southbound lane of a paved road.
Collision Point: Inside the intersection, where V1, due to inexperience, continued turning left across the centerline into the path of V2. V2 struck V1â€™s right side in an L-type configuration.
Adjusted Trajectories Based on Lane Position and Width
Vehicle 1 (V1) - Pickup
Starting Position: In the eastbound lane of the dirt road, stopping briefly before entering the intersection.

Left Turn Trajectory:

Begins a left turn from the east side of the intersection but fails to straighten out, continuing left into the southbound lane of the crossroad.
Collision Point: Near the center of the intersection, where V1 is struck by V2.

Final Position: Both vehicles came to rest off the road on the northwest corner of the intersection.

Trajectory Points:
Starting at (20, 2) in the eastbound lane on the dirt road.
Stopping at the intersection mouth at (10, 2).
Beginning left turn at (5, 1) and drifting into the southbound lane.
Collision at approximately (0, 0).
Final position at (-5, 5), off the northwest corner of the intersection.
V1 Trajectory: [(20, 2), (10, 2), (5, 1), (0, 0), (-5, 5)]

Vehicle 2 (V2) - Utility Vehicle
Starting Position: In the southbound lane of the paved road.

Collision Point: Near the center of the intersection.

Final Position: After the collision, comes to rest off the road on the northwest corner.

Trajectory Points:
Starting at (2, -20) in the southbound lane.
Approaching the intersection at (2, -10).
Collision at (0, 0).
Final position at approximately (-3, 5), off the northwest corner of the intersection.
V2 Trajectory: [(2, -20), (2, -10), (0, 0), (-3, 5)]
