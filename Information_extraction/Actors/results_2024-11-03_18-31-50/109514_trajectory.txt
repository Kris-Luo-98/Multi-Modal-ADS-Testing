Analysis and Output for Provided Crash Case
Based on the crash summary​, road network description, and the provided sketch:

1. Road Setup
Road Type: Five-lane, two-way urban roadway with a center turn lane (two lanes eastbound, center turn lane, two lanes westbound).
Road Length: 50 meters.
Lane Width: 4 meters per lane.
2. Vehicle Identification
Vehicle 1 (V1): 1999 Ford Escort, 4-door station wagon (classified as Car).

Movement: Stopped in the center turn lane, facing west, waiting to turn left across eastbound lanes into a gas station.
Collision Sequence:
Began turning left across eastbound lanes.
First impact: Right fender struck by the front of V3 in an angled L-type collision.
Second impact: Right-rear quarter panel struck by the front of V2 in another L-type collision, redirecting V1 off the south side of the road.
After the impacts, the left side of V1 sideswiped a wooden fence post before coming to rest.
Vehicle 2 (V2): 1993 Ford Ranger, 2-door pickup truck (classified as Car).

Movement: Traveling east in the left eastbound lane, slightly behind V3.
Collision: Front of V2 struck the right-rear quarter panel of V1 after V1's initial collision with V3.
Vehicle 3 (V3): 1993 Saturn SL2, 4-door sedan (classified as Car).

Movement: Traveling east in the right eastbound lane.
Collision: Front of V3 struck the right fender of V1 in an angled L-type collision as V1 attempted a left turn.
3. Coordinate System and Trajectory Mapping
The origin is set at the bottom-left of the eastbound lanes, with:

X-axis extending horizontally to the right (west-to-east direction).
Y-axis extending vertically upwards.
4. Estimated Trajectories
The trajectories are derived from the vehicle movement descriptions and sketch, assuming 1 unit = 1 meter.
