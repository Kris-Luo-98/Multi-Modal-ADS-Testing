Analysis and Output for the Crash Case
1. Road Setup
Road Type: Two-lane, two-way rural road (one lane in each direction: northbound and southbound).
Road Length: 50 meters.
Lane Width: 4 meters per lane.
Grade: Uphill grade for V1 (northbound), downhill grade for V2 (southbound).
Conditions: Daylight, raining, and wet road surface.
2. Vehicle Identification
Vehicle 1 (V1): 2003 Mercury Sable, 4-door sedan (classified as Car).

Movement: Traveling north in the northbound lane.
Collision Sequence: V2 lost control and crossed into V1’s lane, resulting in an offset collision.
Vehicle 2 (V2): 1995 Chevrolet Camaro, 2-door coupe (classified as Car).

Movement: Traveling south in the southbound lane, then lost control and crossed into V1’s path, leading to a collision.
3. Coordinate System and Trajectory Mapping
The origin is set at the bottom-left of the northbound lane, with:

X-axis extending horizontally to the right (north-to-south direction).
Y-axis extending vertically upwards.
4. Corrected Trajectories (Pre-Collision Only)
The trajectories now reflect the specified paths for V1 and V2.

V1's Trajectory (Car):

Starting Point: In the northbound lane at approximately 
(
10
,
2
)
(10,2).
Path: Continues straight in the northbound lane, colliding with V2 at approximately 
(
25
,
2
)
(25,2).
Trajectory Coordinates: 
(
10
,

)
(10,2), 
(

)
(15,2), 
(

)
(25,2).
V2's Trajectory (Car):

Starting Point: In the southbound lane at approximately 
(
40
,
6
)
(40,6), traveling south.
Path: Loses control, crosses the centerline, and collides with V1 in the northbound lane at approximately 
(
25
,
2
)
(25,2).
Trajectory Coordinates: 
(
40
