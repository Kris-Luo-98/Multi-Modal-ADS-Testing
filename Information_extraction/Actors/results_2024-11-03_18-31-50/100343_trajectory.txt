Analysis and Output for Provided Crash Case
Based on the crash summaryâ€‹, road network description, and the provided sketch:

1. Road Setup
Road Type: Straight, divided freeway with two lanes for each direction (northbound and southbound).
Road Length: 55 meters.
Lane Width: 4 meters per lane.
2. Vehicle Identification
Vehicle 1 (V1): 2000 Chevrolet Malibu, 4-door sedan (classified as Car).
Movement: Initially in the right northbound lane, then veered left into the left northbound lane.
Collision: Left side struck by the front of V2 in the left northbound lane.
Vehicle 2 (V2): 1998 International tractor-trailer (classified as Truck).
Movement: Traveling in the left northbound lane, slightly behind V1.
Collision: Front of V2 struck the left side of V1 after V1 veered into its lane.
3. Coordinate System and Trajectory Mapping
The origin is set at the bottom-left of the northbound lanes, with:

X-axis extending horizontally to the right.
Y-axis extending vertically upward.
4. Estimated Trajectories
The trajectories are derived from the vehicle movement descriptions and sketch, assuming 1 unit = 1 meter.
