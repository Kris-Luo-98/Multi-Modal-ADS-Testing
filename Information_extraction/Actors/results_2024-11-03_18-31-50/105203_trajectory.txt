Revised Analysis and Output for the Crash Case
Given the updated trajectory for V3, here is the revised information:

1. Road Setup
Road Type: Straight, two-way rural road with two lanes (one lane for each direction: westbound and eastbound).
Road Length: 50 meters.
Lane Width: 4 meters per lane.
2. Vehicle Identification
Vehicle 1 (V1): 2004 Chevrolet Aveo, 5-door hatchback (classified as Car).

Movement: Traveling west in the westbound lane, following V2. Attempted to swerve left to avoid V2.
Collision: Right side struck the rear corner of V2, then continued into the eastbound lane, colliding with the utility trailer of V3.
Vehicle 2 (V2): 2001 Chevrolet Malibu, 4-door sedan (classified as Car).

Movement: Traveling west in the westbound lane, ahead of V1.
Collision: Rear corner struck by the right side of V1 but continued moving forward in the westbound lane after the impact.
Vehicle 3 (V3): 1999 GMC Sierra K1500 pickup truck with a utility trailer (classified as Truck).

Movement: Traveling east in the eastbound lane.
Collision: Attempted to swerve right to avoid V1 but was struck on the left side of the utility trailer by V1 and continued moving forward in the eastbound lane after the impact.
3. Coordinate System and Trajectory Mapping
The origin is set at the bottom-left of the westbound lane, with:

X-axis extending horizontally to the right (west-to-east direction).
Y-axis extending vertically upwards.
4. Revised Trajectories
The trajectories are revised to reflect the specified path for V3.

V1's Trajectory (Car):

Starting Point: In the westbound lane, approaching from the west, approximately at
