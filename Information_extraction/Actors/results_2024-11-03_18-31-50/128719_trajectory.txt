Analysis and Output for the Crash Case
1. Road Setup
Road Type: Five-lane, two-way road (two lanes northbound, a dual center-turn lane, and two lanes southbound).
Road Length: 50 meters.
Lane Width: 4 meters per lane.
Conditions: Dark, clear weather, and a dry road surface.
2. Vehicle Identification
Vehicle 1 (V1): 2003 Pontiac Grand Am, 4-door sedan (classified as Car).

Movement: Traveling north in the inside northbound lane.
Collision Sequence: V1 continued straight but collided with V2 as V2 drifted into its lane.
Post-Collision Position: V1 sustained disabling front-end damage and was towed from the scene.
Vehicle 2 (V2): 1997 Ford Taurus, 4-door sedan (classified as Car).

Movement: Traveling south in the inside southbound lane, then drifted left across the center-turn lane into V1â€™s path.
Collision Sequence: V2 collided with V1 in an offset-frontal manner as it drifted into the northbound lane.
Post-Collision Position: V2 also sustained disabling damage and was towed from the scene.
3. Coordinate System and Trajectory Mapping
The origin is set at the bottom-left of the northbound lanes, with:

X-axis extending horizontally to the right (north-to-south direction).
Y-axis extending vertically upwards.
4. Corrected Trajectories (Pre-Collision Only)
The trajectories now reflect the specified paths for V1 and V2.

V1's Trajectory (Car):

Starting Point: In the inside northbound lane at approximately 
(
10
,

)
(10,10).
Path: Continues straight in the northbound lane, colliding with V2 in an offset-frontal manner as V2 drifts into its path.
Collision Point: Impact with V2 at approximately 
(
25
,
10
)
(25,10).
Trajectory Coordinates:

V2's Trajectory (Car):

Starting Point: In the inside southbound lane at approximately 
(
40
,
14
)
(40,14), traveling south.
Path: Drifts left across the center-turn lane and into the northbound lane, colliding with V1.
Collision Point: Impact with V1 at approximately 
(
