Analysis and Output for Provided Crash Case
Based on the crash summaryâ€‹, road network description, and the provided sketch:

1. Road Setup
Road Type: Straight, two-way road with two lanes (one lane for each direction: eastbound and westbound).
Road Length: 55 meters.
Lane Width: 4 meters per lane.
2. Vehicle Identification
Vehicle 1 (V1): 1999 Ford Taurus, 4-door sedan (classified as Car).

Movement: Traveling east in the eastbound lane with limited visibility due to an incompletely cleared windshield.
Collision: The front of V1 struck the right side of V2 in a T-type collision.
Vehicle 2 (V2): 2002 Chevrolet Tahoe, 4-door utility vehicle (classified as Car).

Status: A marked police vehicle, stopped at an angle, blocking the eastbound lane.
Collision: Struck on the right side by V1.
3. Coordinate System and Trajectory Mapping
The origin is set at the bottom-left of the eastbound lane (V1's lane), with:

X-axis extending horizontally to the right (east direction).
Y-axis extending vertically upwards.
4. Estimated Trajectories
The trajectories are derived from the vehicle movement descriptions and sketch, assuming 1 unit = 1 meter.

V1's Trajectory (Car):

Starting Point: In the eastbound lane, approaching from the west, approximately at
