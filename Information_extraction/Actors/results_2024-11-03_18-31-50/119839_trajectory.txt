Step 1: Establishing the Coordinate System
For this T-intersection:

The origin (0, 0) is located at the center of the intersection.
The main road extends horizontally along the X-axis, with eastbound lanes to the left (negative X direction) and westbound lanes to the right (positive X direction).
The branch road (north-south) extends vertically along the Y-axis, with northbound lanes at the bottom (negative Y direction) and southbound lanes at the top (positive Y direction).
Each lane is approximately 4 meters wide.

Step 2: Identifying Vehicle Types and Initial Positions
From the crash summary and the output details:

V1 (1999 Ford Windstar, minivan) is confirmed as a Car traveling eastbound in the left lane of the main road.
V2 (2005 Jeep Grand Cherokee, utility vehicle) is identified as a Car traveling northbound in the lane of the branch road, intending to make a left turn (westbound) at the intersection.
From the output and sketch:

V1 approaches the intersection from the left (negative X direction) and travels eastward in the main road's left lane.
V2 approaches the intersection from the bottom (negative Y direction) and intends to turn left (westbound), resulting in a collision with V1.
Step 3: Mapping Trajectories
Vehicle 1 (V1) Trajectory
V1 starts on the main road, eastbound in the left lane.
Approximate trajectory:
Starting at (-20, -2), moving eastward in the left eastbound lane.
Intermediate point at (-10, -2), approaching the intersection.
Collision point at (0, 0), where V2 strikes the right side of V1.
After impact, V1 continues to move slightly eastward to (5, -2), where it comes to rest.
Vehicle 2 (V2) Trajectory
V2 starts on the branch road, traveling northbound.
Approximate trajectory:
Starting at (2, -10), moving northward in the northbound lane.
Intermediate point at (2, -5), approaching the intersection.
Collision point at (0, 0), where it strikes the right side of V1.
After impact, V2 rotates counterclockwise and comes to rest at approximately (-3, 2), facing north-northeast.
Final Output
The final output, based on the given trajectories, is as follows:

{
  "V1_traj": [(-20, -2), (-10, -2), (0, 0), (5, -2)],
  "V1_type": "Car",
  "V2_traj": [(2, -10), (2, -5), (0, 0), (-3, 2)],
  "V2_type": "Car",
  "Validation": "Passed"
}
