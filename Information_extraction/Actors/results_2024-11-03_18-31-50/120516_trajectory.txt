Road Network and Coordinate Setup
Road Type: Intersection (4-leg).
Lane Configuration: Two-lane, two-way road (one lane in each direction).
Lane Width: 4 meters per lane.
Coordinate System: Origin is at the center of the intersection, with the X-axis extending horizontally and the Y-axis vertically.
Vehicle and Collision Information
V1: 2003 Ford Taurus (Sedan), traveling east in the eastbound lane of a bituminous rural highway with a negative slope.
V2: 2005 Ford F150 (Extended Cab Pickup), traveling north in the northbound lane of a gravel road with a negative slope.
Collision Point: Center of the intersection, where the front of V1 struck the left side of V2 in an L-type configuration.
Post-Collision Dynamics:
V2 rotated clockwise and came to rest partially off the south shoulder, facing east-southeast.
V1 was redirected slightly northward, coming to a controlled stop on the north shoulder, facing east-northeast.
Adjusted Trajectories Based on Lane Position and Width
Vehicle 1 (V1) - Car
Approaching from the West (Eastbound Lane):

Trajectory Points:
Starting at (-20, -2) in the eastbound lane.
Moving toward the intersection at (-10, -2).
Collision at the center of the intersection at (0, 0).
Post-impact movement toward the north shoulder at (2, 2).
Final resting position at (5, 3), facing east-northeast.
V1 Trajectory: [(-20, -2), (-10, -2), (0, 0), (2, 2), (5, 3)]

Vehicle 2 (V2) - Car
Approaching from the South (Northbound Lane):

Trajectory Points:
Starting at (2, -20) in the northbound lane.
Moving toward the intersection at (2, -10).
Collision at the center of the intersection at (0, 0).
Post-impact movement to the south shoulder at (3, -2).
Final resting position at approximately (5, -3), facing east-southeast.
V2 Trajectory: [(2, -20), (2, -10), (0, 0), (3, -2), (5, -3)]
