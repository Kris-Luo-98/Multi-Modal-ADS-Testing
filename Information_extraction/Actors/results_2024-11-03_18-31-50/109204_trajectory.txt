Road Network and Coordinate Setup
Road Type: Intersection (4-leg).
Lane Setup: Five-lane, two-way road (two westbound lanes, a center left-turn lane, and two eastbound lanes).
Lane Width: 3.5 meters per lane.
For eastbound lanes, the centerline of each lane is positioned at intervals of 3.5 meters.
Coordinate System: Origin is at the center of the intersection, with the X-axis extending horizontally and the Y-axis vertically.
Vehicle and Collision Information
V1: 2002 Chevrolet Trailblazer (Car), traveling east in the center left-turn lane, then turning left (north).
V2: 2002 Freightliner FLD-120 (Truck), traveling east in the right eastbound lane.
Collision Point: Inside the intersection, where V1 turned left across the path of V2, resulting in an L-type impact on the right side of V1.
Adjusted Trajectories Based on Lane Position and Width
Vehicle 1 (V1) - Car
Starting Position: In the center left-turn lane (located at Y = 1.75 meters from the centerline).

Left Turn Trajectory:

Begins to turn left as it enters the intersection.
Collision Point: Center of the intersection at approximately (10, 0).

Rotation and Final Position: After the collision, V1 rotates clockwise and moves to rest partially off the northwest corner.

Trajectory Points:
Starting at (30, 1.75) near the center left-turn lane.
Entering the intersection at around (20, 1.75).
Collision at (10, 0).
Post-collision rotation at approximately (5, -5), coming to rest facing northwest.
V1 Trajectory: [(30, 1.75), (20, 1.75), (10, 0), (5, -5)]

Vehicle 2 (V2) - Truck
Starting Position: In the right eastbound lane (positioned at Y = -1.75 meters).

Collision Point: Center of the intersection at approximately (10, 0).

Final Position: Remains within the intersection after sideslapping with V1.

Trajectory Points:
Starting at (0, -1.75) in the eastbound lane.
Moving towards (5, -1.75).
Collision at (10, 0).
Post-collision position at (15, -1.75).
V2 Trajectory: [(0, -1.75), (5, -1.75), (10, 0), (15, -1.75)]
