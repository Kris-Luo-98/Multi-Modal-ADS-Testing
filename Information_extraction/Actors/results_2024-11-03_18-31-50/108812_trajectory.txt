Based on the information provided in the crash summary, crash sketch, and road network, here is the breakdown:

Step 1: Road Structure and Coordinate System
Road Type: Curve, with a slight left turn for eastbound (V1’s direction) and a slight right turn for westbound (V2’s direction).
Lanes: Two lanes, one per direction (two-way rural road).
Coordinate System: Set the origin at the bottom-left of the curve, aligning the X-axis horizontally to the right and the Y-axis vertically upward.
Step 2: Vehicle Identification and Types
Vehicle 1 (V1): A 1998 Mercury Mountaineer (Utility Vehicle), identified as Car in this context.
Vehicle 2 (V2): A 2002 Ford F150 (Pickup Truck), identified as Car.
Step 3: Analyzing the Crash Sketch and Summary for Trajectories
V1 (Car):

Starting Position: Eastbound lane (lower lane in the sketch), moving leftward through the curve.
Collision Point: Front-to-front collision with V2 in V1’s lane (indicating a crossover by V2).
Post-Collision: V1 veered off the right side of the road and came to rest facing south.
V2 (Truck):

Starting Position: Westbound lane (upper lane in the sketch), moving rightward through the curve.
Collision Point: Crossed into the eastbound lane, striking V1’s front.
Post-Collision: Redirected back to its lane briefly, then crossed the eastbound lane again, coming to rest off the south side of the road.
Step 4: Predicted Trajectories in 2D Coordinates
Using approximate measurements based on vehicle positions and road structure, here’s a predicted trajectory for each vehicle:

V1 (Car - Mercury Mountaineer)
Trajectory:
Starting point: (5, 2)
Mid-curve point: (15, 4)
Collision point: (25, 6)
Post-collision rest: (35, 1) (off-road, facing south)
V2 (Car - Ford F150)
Trajectory:
Starting point: (45, 10)
Mid-curve point: (35, 8)
Collision point: (25, 6) (entered V1’s lane)
Redirected point: (15, 7) (back in its lane)
Final rest: (5, 3) (off-road, south side)
Final Output

{
  "V1_traj": [(5, 2), (15, 4), (25, 6), (35, 1)],
  "V1_type": "Car",
  "V2_traj": [(45, 10), (35, 8), (25, 6), (15, 7), (5, 3)],
  "V2_type": "Car",
  "Validation": "Passed"
}
