Based on the information from the crash summary, crash sketch, and road network, here’s the analysis for this case:

Step 1: Road Structure and Coordinate System
Road Type: Curve, with V1 (westbound) negotiating a right curve and V2 (eastbound) negotiating a left curve.
Lanes: Two lanes, one per direction (two-way road).
Lane Width: 3.5 meters per lane, which slightly narrows the road compared to typical lanes.
Coordinate System: Set the origin at the bottom-left of the curve, with the X-axis extending horizontally to the right and the Y-axis vertically upward.
Step 2: Vehicle Identification and Types
Vehicle 1 (V1): A 2002 Subaru Forester (Utility Vehicle), identified as Car.
Vehicle 2 (V2): A 2002 Buick Rendezvous (Utility Vehicle), also identified as Car.
Step 3: Analyzing the Crash Sketch and Summary for Trajectories
V1 (Car - Subaru Forester):

Starting Position: Westbound lane, approaching a right curve on an icy road.
Loss of Control: The driver of V1 lost control on the ice, causing the vehicle to rotate counterclockwise approximately 90 degrees.
Centerline Crossing: After rotating, V1 crossed into the eastbound lane, resulting in a side impact.
Collision Point: V2 struck the right side of V1 in a T-type configuration (V1’s side impacted by V2’s front).
V2 (Car - Buick Rendezvous):

Starting Position: Eastbound lane, negotiating the left curve.
Collision Point: Could not avoid V1 after it crossed the centerline, resulting in a T-type impact with the right side of V1.
Step 4: Predicted Trajectories in 2D Coordinates
Using estimated positions based on the crash description, here is the predicted trajectory for each vehicle:

V1 (Car - Subaru Forester)
Trajectory:
Starting point: (5, 2) (westbound lane, entering the curve).
Loss of control and rotation: (15, 4).
Crosses centerline: (20, 6).
Collision point with V2: (25, 6) (right side of V1 struck by front of V2).
V2 (Car - Buick Rendezvous)
Trajectory:
Starting point: (35, 8) (eastbound lane).
Avoidance attempt: (30, 7).
Collision point: (25, 6) (front-to-right side impact with V1).
Final Output

{
  "V1_traj": [(5, 2), (15, 4), (20, 6), (25, 6)],
  "V1_type": "Car",
  "V2_traj": [(35, 8), (30, 7), (25, 6)],
  "V2_type": "Car",
  "Validation": "Passed"
}
