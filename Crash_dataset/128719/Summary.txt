Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2003 Pontiac Grand Am, 4-door sedan was traveling north in the inside northbound lane of a five-lane, two-way road (two lanes northbound, dual center-turn lane, two lanes southbound). Vehicle two (V2), a 1997 Ford Taurus, 4-door sedan was traveling south in the inside southbound lane of the same road. It was dark, the weather was clear and the bituminous road surface was dry. For unknown reasons, V2 drifted to the left, crossed the center-turn lane and entered the inside northbound lane. The driver of V1 was not able to take evasive manuever and the front of V2 struck the front of V1 in an offset-frontal configuration. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage. The 31-year-old male driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. He sustained serious injuries and was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital and was later transferred to a regional level-one trauma center.
