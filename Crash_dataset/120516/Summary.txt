Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle) a 2003 Ford Taurus, 4-door sedan was traveling east in the eastbound lane of a two-lane, two-way bituminous rural highway. V1 was traveling down a negative slope and approaching a four-leg intersection with a two-lane gravel road. Vehicle two (V2) a 2005 Ford F150 extended cab pickup (1/2 ton, 4x4, unknown wheelbase) was traveling north in the northbound lane of this two-lane, two-way gravel road, also traveling a negative slope, and approaching the same intersection as V1, which was controlled by stop signs for the north-south dirt road. It was daylight, raining, and the roads were wet. V2 began to enter the intersection as V1 was passing through and the front of V1 struck the left side of V2 in an L-type configuration. The impact caused V2 to rotate clockwise and be redirected toward the east where it came to rest partially off the south shoulder facing east-southeast. After the initial impact, V1 was redirected slightly toward a more northerly direction and it came to a controlled stop on the north shoulder facing east-northeast. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling damage. The 41-year-old female driver of V1 (non-case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed, she refused medical treatment and sustained minor contusions and sprains (ISS-2). The 73-year-old female right-front passenger (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the dash-mounted air bag deployed. She was transported to a regional level-one trauma center via ground ambulance and hospitalized for treatment.
