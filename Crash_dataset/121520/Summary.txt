Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2001 Chevrolet Monte Carlo, 2-door coupe was traveling south in the left southbound lane of a five-lane, two-way urban road. Vehicle two (V2), a 1995 Pontiac Firebird, 2-door coupe was traveling north in the middle left-turn lane of the same road. It was daylight, the weather was cloudy, and the bituminous road surface was dry. V2 began to initiate a left-turn at the same time that V1 was passing through the intersection and the front of V1 struck the right side of V2 in an oblique, L-type configuration. V1 reportedly rotated clockwise ninety degrees and came to rest in the intersection facing west. V2 reportedly rotated counterclockwise and came to rest in the western side of the intersection facing west-northwest. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 20-year-old male driver of V2 sustained unknown injuries but refused treatement. The 50-year-old female driver of V1 (non-case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. She was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center where she was treated and released (ISS-2). The 83-year-old female right-front passenger of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the dash-mounted air bag deployed. She was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center and was hospitalized for treatment (ISS-11).
