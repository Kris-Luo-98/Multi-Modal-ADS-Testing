Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2001 Chrysler Sebring, 4-door sedan was traveling south in the left southbound lane of five-lane, two-way urban roadway and was approaching a four-leg intersection with the intention of passing straight through. Vehicle two (V2), a 2000 Chevrolet Venture, minivan was traveling north in the center turn lane and was approaching the same intersection with the intention of turning left. It was dark with streetlights, the weather was clear and the bituminous road surface was dry. As V1 entered the intersection, the driver of V2 attempted to turn left and the front of V2 struck the front of V1 in an oblique, offset-frontal configuration. The final resting positions and vehicle orientations at rest are not known. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 30-year-old female driver of V1 (non-case occupant) was not using the available three-point seat belt but the steering-wheel air bag deployed. She was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital for treatment of numerous thoracic, pelvic and lower extremity injuries (ISS-22). The 26-year-old male right-front passenger of V1 (non-case occupant) was not using the available three-point seat belt but the dash-mounted air bag deployed. He was transported to a local hospital and later transferred to a regional level-one trauma center for treatment of numerous pelvic and lower extremity injuries (ISS-10+). The 4-year-old female center-rear passenger (case occupant) was seated in a highback booster seat and was using the available three-point seat belt. She was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital and later transferred to a regional level-one trauma center.
