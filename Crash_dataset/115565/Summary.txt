Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 1997 Ford Explorer, 4-door utility vehicle was traveling west in the westbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural roadway and was approaching a 4-leg intersection controlled by stop signs for the east-west road. Vehicle two (V2), a 2005 Chevrolet Trailblazer, 4-door utility vehicle was traveling north in the northbound lane of a two-lane, two-way road and was approaching the same intersection as V1. It was daylight, raining, and the asphalt road was wet. V1 reportedly stopped at the intersection and then began to initiate a left turn. The driver of V2 braked and steered left but was unable to avoid contact with V1. The front of V2 struck the left side of V1 in an oblique L-type configuration. After initial impact, V2 was re-directed to the left while V1 rotated clockwise rapidly causing the left rear portion of V1 to contact the right side of V2 in a sideslap configuration. V2 then departed the road off the northwest corner and came to rest facing north-northwest. V1 came to rest facing north in the southbound lane. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 19-year-old female driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available 3-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. She was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital and subsequently airlifted to a regional level-one trauma center with severe injuries.
