Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 1993 Ford Taurus, 4-door sedan was traveling south in the southbound lane of a two-lane, two-way, rural road and was approaching a four-leg intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 1992 Chevrolet Caprice, 4-door sedan was traveling east in the eastbound lane of the intersecting two-lane, two-way rural road. It was daylight the weather was clear, and the bituminous road surface was dry. V1 and V2 entered into the intersection at the same time and the front of V1 struck the left-side of V2 in an L-type configuration. The impact caused the two vehicles to be redirected toward the southeast corner and the two vehicles sideslapped, with the right side of V1 striking the left side of V2. Both vehicles separated and both exited the southeast corner of the intersection and came to rest in an agricultural field. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 33-year-old female driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. She was pregnant (10.5 weeks gestation) at the time of the crash. She was transported via helicopter to a regional level-one trauma center with moderate injuries.
