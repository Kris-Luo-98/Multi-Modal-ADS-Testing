Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2000 Honda Civic, 2-door coupe was traveling north in the northbound through-lane of a three-lane, two-way urban road and was approaching a four-leg intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 2002 Ford Explorer (unknown specific type) was traveling west in the westbound through-lane of the intersecting three-lane, two-way road and was approaching the same intersection as V1. It was dark, there were no streetlights, the weather was clear, and the bituminous road was dry. Both vehicles entered the intersection at the same time and the front of V2 struck the right side of V1 in a T-type configuration. There was no physical evidence to substantiate the final resting positions of either vehicle nor were there any police markings. Both vehicles were towed, reportedly due to disabling vehicle damage. The 17-year-old female driver of V1 was using the available three-point seat belt but no air bags deployed. She was transported to a local hospital via ground ambulance (ISS-1) where she was treated and released. The 17-year-old female right-front passenger of V1 (case occupant) was also using the available three-point seat belt but no air bags deployed. She was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center.
