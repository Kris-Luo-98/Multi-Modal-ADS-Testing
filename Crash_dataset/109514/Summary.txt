Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 1999 Ford Escort, 4-door station wagon was stopped facing west in the center-turn of a five-lane, two-way roadway (two lanes eastbound, center turn lane, two lanes westbound). Vehicle 3 (V3), a 1993 Saturn SL2, 4-door sedan was traveling east in the right eastbound lane. Vehicle 2 (V2), a 1993 Ford Ranger, 2-door pickup truck was traveling east in the left eastbound lane and was slightly behind V3. It was dark, the streetlights were illuminated, the weather was clear and the bituminous road was dry. The driver of V1 was waiting for traffic to clear before attempting to turn left into a gas station. The driver of V1 believed that the eastbound traffic had cleared and began to turn left across the eastbound lanes. The driver of V3 was unable to avoid a collision and the front of V3 struck the right fender of V1 in an angled L-type configuration. V1 began to rotate counterclockwise but the front of V2 then struck the right-rear quarter panel of V1 and an L-type configuration. V1 was then redirected off the south side of the road. The left side of V1 then sideswiped a wooden fence post before coming to rest. All three vehicles were reportedly towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 79-year-old male driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel airbag deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital and later transferred to a regional level-one trauma center.
