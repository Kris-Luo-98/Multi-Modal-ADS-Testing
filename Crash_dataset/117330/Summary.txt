Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2000 Chevrolet Blazer, 2-door utility vehicle was traveling east in the eastbound lane of a two-lane, two-way, rural roadway. Vehicle two (V2), a 2001 Honda Accord, 4-door sedan was traveling west in the westbound lane of the same roadway. It was daylight, cloudy, and the bituminous road was icy. The driver of V2 reportedly lost control on the icy road and drove left-of-center causing the front of V2 to strike the front of V1 in an offset-frontal configuration. The impact caused V2 to rotate counterclockwise approximately 80 degrees and come to rest in the road facing south-southwest. The impact caused V1 to rotate counterclockwise, depart the right side of the road, and trip over its right wheels. V1 rolled three quarter turns and came to rest on its left side, in the right ditch, facing north-northeast. Both vehicles were towed from the scene due to diabling vehicle damage. The 29-year-old male driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center.
