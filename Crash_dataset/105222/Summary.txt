Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee, 4-door utility vehicle was traveling north in the left northbound lane of a four-lane, two-way urban roadway (two lanes northbound, two lanes southbound). Vehicle two (V2), a 1996 Ford Contour, 4-door sedan was traveling south in the left southbound lane of the same roadway. It was daylight, the skies were clear, and the bituminous road was dry. The driver of V1 suddenly recognized slowing or stopped traffic in front of him and he swerved to the left to avoid striking the rear of another vehicle. This maneuver placed his vehicle in the left southbound lane where the driver of V2 could not avoid a collision. The front of V1 struck the front of V2 in an offset mode. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 65-year-old male driver of V1 (case occupant) was not using the available three-point seat belt but the steering-wheel airbag deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital and later transferred (via helicopter) to a regional level-one trauma center.
