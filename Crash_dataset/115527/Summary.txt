Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 1998 Buick Century, 4-door sedan was traveling north in the left northbound lane of a five-lane, two-way urban road and was approaching a 4-leg intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 1998 Pontiac Transport was traveling west in the left westbound lane of the intersecting five-lane road and was approaching the same intersection. The overhead traffic lights were not functioning due to a previous electrical storm and the intersection was functioning as a four-way stop. The driver of V1 reported that he had stopped and then proceeded to pass straight through the intersection. The driver of V2 was unaware that the light was not functioning and proceeded into the intersection. The front of V2 struck the right side of V1 in a T-type configuration. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 47-year-old male driver of V1 (non-case occupant) was using the available 3-point seat belt and the steering-wheel airbag deployed. He refused medical treatment. The 48-year-old female right-front passenger of V1 (case occupant) was using the available 3-point seat belt and the dash-mounted airbag deployed. She was transported to a local hospital and was then transferred to a regional level-one trauma center. The unknown age male driver of V2 was transported to a local hospital and no further data was obtained for this individual.
