Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2001 Ford Taurus, 4-door sedan was traveling east in the eastbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural road. Vehicle two (V2), a 1996 Jeep Grand Cherokee, 4-door utility vehicle was traveling west in the westbound lane of the same road. It was daylight, the weather was clear but windy, and the bituminous road surface was icy. The driver of V2 lost control on the icy surface and drove left-of-center, crossing the center line. The driver of V1 was unable to avoid V2 and the front of V1 struck the front of V2 in a full-frontal mode. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 40-year-old female driver of V2 was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital with unknown injuries. The 25-year-old male driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital and later transferred to a regional level-one trauma center. The 23-year-old female right-front passenger (case occupant) was also using the available three-point seat belt and the dash-mounted air bag deployed. She was also transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital and later transferred to a regional level-one trauma center.
