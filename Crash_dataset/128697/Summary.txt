Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2002 Volkswagen New Beetle, 2-door hatchback was traveling west in the westbound lane of a two-lane, two-way roadway. Vehicle two (V2), a 1995 Chevrolet Monte Carlo, 2-door coupe was traveling east in the eastbound lane of the same roadway. It was daylight, the weather was cloudy, and the bituminous road surface was dry. The driver of V2 reportedly fell asleep, relinquinshed control of her vehicle, and drifted to the left, crossing the centerline. The driver of V1 was unable to avoid V2 and the front of V2 struck the front of V1 in an offset-frontal mode. Upon impact, V1 rotated counterclockwise approxiamtely 170 degrees and came to rest off the north edge of the road facing east-southeast. V2 rotated counterclockwise approximately 40 degrees and came to rest in the westbound lane facing north-northeast. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 22-year-old female driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. She was transported via helicopter to a regional level-one trauma center. There were no other occupants of V1.
