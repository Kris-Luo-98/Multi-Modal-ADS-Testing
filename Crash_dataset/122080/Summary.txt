Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 1998 Cadillac Catera, 4-door sedan was traveling north in the northbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural road and was approaching a controlled four-leg intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 1994 GMC Vandura 2500, passenger van was traveling east in the eastbound lane of the intersecting road. The intersection is controlled by stop signs for northbound and southbound traffic. It was daylight, the weather was clear, and the bituminous road surfaces were dry. V1 and V2 entered the intersection at the same time and the front of V2 struck the left side of V1. Upon impact, V1 began to rapidly rotate in a counter clockwise manner and departed the road at the northeast corner of the intersection. V1 rotated apporximately 330 degrees, striking a utility box with it's left fender, and came to rest off the road facing north-northeast. Upon impact, V2 was re-directed in a north-easterly direction, departed the left side of the road downstream from the intersection, and came to rest off the road facing north-northeast. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The driver and two passenger of V2 were transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital with unknown injuries. The 21-year-old male driver of V1 (case occupant) was alone in the vehicle and was using the available three-point seat belt but no air bags deployed. He was transported via helicopter to a regional level-one trauma center.
