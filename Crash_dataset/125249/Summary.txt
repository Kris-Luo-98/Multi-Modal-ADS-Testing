Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2000 Dodge Dakota, Quad Cab pickup was traveling south in the southbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural road and was approaching a 4-leg intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 2006 Saturn Ion, 4-door sedan was traveling north in the northbound lane of the same road and was approaching the same 4-left intersection. V2 was traversing a negative grade while V1 was traversing a positive grade. It was dark, the weather was clear, and the bituminous road surface was dry. The driver of V1 attempted to turn left across the path of V2 but was unable to avoid striking the front of V2 with the front of V1. V2 reportedly rotated clockwise approximately 120 degrees and came to rest in the southbound lane facing south-southeast. The driver of V1, who had accelerated prior to impact, was redirected slightly in a counter-clockwise manner and came to a controlled stop in the westbound lane of the east leg of the intersection facing east-northeast. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 26-year-old male driver of V2 sustained police-reported "C" (possible) injuries and refused medical treatment. The 32-year-old female right-front passenger of V2 sustained police-reported "A" injuries (incapacitating) and was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center (unknown ISS level). The 45-year-male driver of V1 (case occupant) was not using the available three-point seat belt but the steering-wheel air bag deployed. He was sustained police-reported "A" injuries (incapacitating) and was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center (ISS-10).
