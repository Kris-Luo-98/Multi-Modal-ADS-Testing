Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 1994 Chevrolet G20, conversion van was traveling north in the northbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural roadway and approaching a controlled, four-leg intersection with another two-lane, two-way roadway. Vehicle two (V2), a 1992 Ford F150, pickup truck was traveling east in the eastbound lane of the intersecting roadway. It was daylight, the weather was clear, and the bituminous road surface was dry. Both vehicles entered the intersection at the same time and the front of V2 struck the left side of V1 in an L-type configuration. The impact caused both vehicles to rotate clockwise such that the right side of V2 struck the left side of V1 in a sideslap type configuration. V1 was redirected to the northeast, departed the roadway and came to rest off the northeast corner of the intersection, facing north-northeast. V2 was also redirected toward the northeast, departed the northeast corner of the intersection and came to rest facing north-northeast. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 35-year-old male driver of V2 was reportedly using the available three-point seat belt, but no airbags deployed. He sustained police-reported "A" (incapacitating) injuries and was transported to a local hospital with unknown specific injuries. The 24-year-old female driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. She was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital and later tranferred to a regional level-one trauma center.
