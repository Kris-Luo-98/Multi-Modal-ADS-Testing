Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2004 Ford Taurus, 4-door sedan was traveling south in the southbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural road and was approaching a four-leg intersection. Vehicle two (V2 - case vehicle), a 1997 Chevrolet Lumina, 4-door sedan was traveling east in the eastbound lane of the intersecting two-lane, two-way road. It was dark with no streetlights, the weather was clear, and the bituminous road was dry. The driver of V2 reportedly fell asleep and both V1 and V2 entered the intersection at the same time. The driver of V1 could not avoid striking V2 and the front of V1 struck the left side of V2 in an L-type configuration. The impact caused V1 to rotate counterclockwise and V2 clockwise, resulting in a side-slap impact between the right side of V1 and the left side of V2. This secondary impact caused both vehicles to stop their respective rotations and both departed the southeast corner of the intersection and into a plowed agricultural field. V1 came to rest off the southeast corner facing south-southeast. V2 continued several meters into the field and came to rest facing south-southeast. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 32-year-old male driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center. The 31-year-old female right-front passenger of V1 (case occupant) was also using the available three-point seat belt and the dash-mounted air bag deployed. She was transported via helicopter to a regional level-one trauma center. The 39-year-old male driver of V2 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center.
