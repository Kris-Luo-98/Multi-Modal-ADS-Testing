Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2001 Ford Taurus, 4-door sedan was traveling east in the left eastbound lane of an eight lane, limited access freeway (four lanes eastbound, protected median/divider, four lanes westbound). Vehicle two (V2), a 1990 Ford Bronco II, 2-door utility vehicle was traveling west also in the left eastbound lane of the same roadway. It was dark with artificial illumination, the weather was clear, and the bituminous road surface was dry. The driver of V1 saw the oncoming headlights of V2, braked and steered to the left as an avoidance maneuver, but the front of V2 struck the front of V1 in an offset-frontal mode. V2 crushed and overrode the front of V1 eventually striking the right portion of the windshield and windshield header before rotating down the right side of V1 and separating. V1 experienced a minor fire susbsequent to the intial crash that was confined to the right engine compartment. The final resting positions and vehicle orientations of both vehicles are unknown. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 19-year-old female driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. She was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital and later transferred to a regional level-one trauma center. The 26-year-old male right-front passenger was using the available three-point seat belt and the dash-mounted air bag deployed. He sustained unknown fatal injuries, was pronounced dead at the scene and was transported to the county morgue. The 19-year-old male left-rear passenger was using the available three-point belt. He sustained unknown injuries and was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital for treatment.
