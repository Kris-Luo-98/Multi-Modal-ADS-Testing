Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2003 Ford Taurus, 4-door sedan was traveling north in the northbound lane of a two-lane, two-way, rural roadway. Vehicle two (V2), a 2004 Saab 9-5, 4-door sedan was traveling south in the southbound lane of the same roadway. Vehicle three (V3), a 2004 Ford Freestar minivan was also traveling south in the southbound lane and was behind V2. It was dawn, raining, and the bituminous road was wet. V1 was exiting a right curve and V2 was just about to enter the curve from the opposite direction. As V1 was exited the curve the driver of V1, for an unknown reason, allowed the vehicle to drift to the left and cross the centerline. The driver of V2 attempted to avoid the collision by steering right, but the front of V1 struck the front of V2 in an oblique offset-frontal type configuration. V1 rotated counterclockwise, separating from V2 and came to rest in the northbound lane facing east. V3 could not avoid V1 and the front of V3 struck the left-rear corner of V1. V1 and V2 were towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage. V3 was driven from the scene. The 42-year-old female driver of V2 (non-case occupant) was fatally injured during the crash and was pronounced dead at the scene. The 38-year-old female driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel airbag deployed. The 18-year-old female right-front passenger (non-case occupant) was also using the available three-point seat belt and the dash-mounted airbag deployed. Both occupants of the case vehicle were transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center.
