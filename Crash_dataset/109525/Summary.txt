Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 1999 Chevrolet S10, 2-door pickup truck was traveling north in the northbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural roadway. Vehicle two (V2), a unknown year/make/model tractor pulling one trailer was traveling south in the southbound lane of the same roadway. It was dawn, the skies were cloudy, and the biturminous road was dry. The driver of V1 reportedly fell asleep and V1 drifted to the left, crossing the centerline, and entering the southbound lane. The front of V1 struck the left side of V2's power unit causing a fuel tank rupture in V2. V1 rotated counter clockwise down the left side of V2. V1 separated from V2 and departed the right side of the road coming to rest in a ditch facing northeast. V2 caught on fire due to the fuel tank rupture, departed the right side of the road and came to rest against a large tree. The driver of V2 exited the vehicle before it became engulfed in flames and was completely burned. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 18-year-old driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel airbag deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital and later transferred to a regional level-one trauma center.
