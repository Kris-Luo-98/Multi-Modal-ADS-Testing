Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2000 GMC Sonoma, 3-door extended cab pickup truck was traveling north in the left northbound lane of a four-lane, two-way road (two lanes northbound, two lanes southbound). Vehicle two (V2), a 2001 Buick Regal, 4-door sedan was traveling south in the right southbound lane of the same road. It was dark and sleeting and the bituminous road surface was icy. The driver of V1 lost control on the icy surface and his vehicle began a counterclockwise rotation as it crossed the centerline of the road. The driver of V2 was unable to avoid V1 and the front of V2 struck the right side of V1 in a T-type configuration. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 26-year-old female driver of V2 was transported to a local hospital and hospitalized with unknown injuries. The 23-year-old male driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt but no air bags deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital and later transferred to a regional level-one trauma center.
