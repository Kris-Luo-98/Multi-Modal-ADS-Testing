Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2003 Saturn LW300, 4-door station wagon was traveling north in the northbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural highway. Vehicle two (V2), a 2003 Cadillac CTS, 4-door sedan was traveling south in the southbound lane of the same road. It was daylight, the weather was clear, and the bituminous road surface was dry. The road has a 1% positive grade in the northbound direction. As the two vehicles approached each other, the driver of V1, for an unknown reason, crossed the centerline into the southbound lane and the path of V2. The driver of V2 reportedly steered right but could not avoid a collision and the front of V1 struck the front of V2 in an offset-frontal mode. Both vehicles reportedly rotated counterclockwise and came to rest. V1 reportedly came to rest in the northbound lane facing west and V2 reportedly came to rest partially on the west shoulder facing south-southeast. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 85-year-old male driver and lone occupant of V2 was reportedly using the three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. He was pronounced dead at the scene from unknown injuries. The 81-year-old male driver and lone occupant of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital and transferred via helicopter to a regional level-one trauma center. He was transferred 28 days post-injury date to a rehabilitation center where he died of sepsis 32 days post-injury date.
