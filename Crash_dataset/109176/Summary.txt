Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2002 Pontiac Aztek, a 4-door utility vehicle was traveling south in the right southbound lane of a 4-lane,divided, limited access freeway (two lanes southbound, unprotected median, two lanes northbound). Vehicle two (V2), a 2000 Chevrolet K3500, crew cab pickup pulling a three-axle auto transport trailer was also traveling south in the right southbound lane of the same road and was ahead of V1. It was daylight, the sky was clear, and the concrete road was dry. The driver of V1 reported that he was about to sneeze, but tried to fight it off. This caused him to become momentarily distracted and he failed to recognize that traffic in front of him had slowed due to traffic congestion and an upcoming road work zone. When the driver realized that traffic was moving much slower he swerved hard to the right but could not avoid the trailer of V2. The front of V1 struck the rear of V2's trailer. The impact caused V1 to rotate counterclockwise approximately 80 degrees and V1 came to rest off the right shoulder, facing east-southeast. V1 was towed due to disabling vehicle damage. V2 was driven from the scene, but the trailer hitch was deformed enough that it required towing from the scene. The 47-year-old male driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel airbag deployed. He was transported via helicopter to a regional level-one trauma center.
