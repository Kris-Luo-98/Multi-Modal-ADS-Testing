Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2002 Honda Accord, 4-door sedan was traveling in a northeasterly direction on a one-lane, one-way freeway entrance ramp to a limited access freeway. This access ramp exhibits a downhill grade (>2%) and curves to the right as it merges with the freeway. Vehicle two (V2), a 2006 Freightliner tractor pulling one trailer was traveling east in the right eastbound lane of a five-lane limited access freeway (two lanes westbound, center divider, two through lanes eastbound and one merging entrance ramp on the eastbound side). It was dark, unlighted, the weather was clear and the bituminous road surfaces were dry. The driver of V1 entered the right curve at too great of speed and the driver was unable to merge into the right eastbound lane in a controlled manner. V1 drove left into V2s lane, ran under V2s trailer and was struck on the left side by an unknown trailer component. V2 felt the impact and came to a controlled stop on the right shoulder downstream from the impact. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 49-year-old male driver of V2 was not injured, refused treatment at the scene, and was not transported to a hospital. The 24-year-old male driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt but no air bags deployed. He ws transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center and hospitalized.
