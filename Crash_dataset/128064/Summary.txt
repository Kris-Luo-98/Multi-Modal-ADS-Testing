Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2002 Ford Taurus, 4-door sedan was traveling north in the northbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural roadway and was approaching a four-leg intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 1998 Ford F150 supercab pickup truck was traveling east in the eastbound lane of the intersecting two-lane, two-way roadway and approaching the same intersection as V1. It was dusk, the weather was cloudy, and the bituminous road surface was dry. Both vehicles entered the intersection at the same time and the front of V2 struck the left side of V1 in a T-type configuration. V1 rotated counterclockwise approximately 250 degrees before exiting the northeast corner of the intersection where the left fender struck a utility pole. V1 reportedly rotated clockwise approximately 80 degrees around this pole and continued in a northeasterly direction. V1 struck a utility box with the right side and came to rest against this box facing south-southwest. V2 reportedly rotated counterclockwise approximately 160 degrees and departed the left side of the roadway and came to rest off the northeast corner facing west-southwest. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 17-year-old female driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and no air bags deployed. She was transported via helicopter to a regional level-one trauma center. The 19-year-old right-front passenger of V1 (non-case occupant) was also using the available three-point seat belt and no air bags deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital with a mild non-anatomical brain injury (MAIS-2, ISS-5).
