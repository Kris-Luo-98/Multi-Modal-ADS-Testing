Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 1999 Ford Windstar, minivan was traveling east in the left eastbound lane of a five-lane, two-way bituminous urban road (two lanes eastbound, center turn lane, two lanes westbound) and was approaching a T-intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 2005 Jeep Grand Cherokee, 4-door utility vehicle was traveling north in the northbound lane of a two-lane, two-way concrete road that intersect with the east-west road. It was daylight, the weather was clear, and the road surfaces were dry. As V1 was traversing through the T-intersection, the driver of V2 attempted to turn left so as to travel westbound and the front of V2 struck the right-side of V1 in an oblique manner. The impact caused V1 to rotate in a clockwise manner as it continued toward the north-east and V1 came to rest in the left westbound lane facing west-southwest. V2 was rotated clockwise apporximately 80 degrees and came to rest in the eastbound lanes facing north-northeast. V1 was towed from the scene due to disabling vehicle damage and V2 was driven from the scene. The 61-year-old female driver (non-case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt but no air bags deployed. She was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital and treated and released (ISS-1). The 62-year-old male right-front passenger (case occupant) was also using the available three-point seat belt and no air bags deployed. He was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital, treated for approximately three weeks, and discharged home. He returned to this hospital and was transferred to a regional level-one trauma center.
