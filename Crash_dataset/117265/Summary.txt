Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2004 Ford Focus, 4-door station wagon was traveling north in the left northbound lane of a five-lane, two-way urban road and was approaching an uncontrolled four-leg intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 1997 GMC G10 cargo van was traveling south in the southbound lane of the same road and attempted to make a left turn at the four-leg intersection. As V2 began its turn across the path of V1, the driver of V1 swerved to the right but was unable to avid being struck by V2. The front of V2 struck the left side of V1. The impact caused V2 to rotate counterclockwise approximately 80 degrees and V2 came to rest in the intersection facing north-northeast. V1 also came to a stop in the intersection facing north-northeast. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 69-year-old female driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the steering-wheel air bag deployed. She was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital and later airlifted to a regional level-one trauma center. She had no passengers in V1 but was transporting a large (unknown breed) dog in the rear seat.
