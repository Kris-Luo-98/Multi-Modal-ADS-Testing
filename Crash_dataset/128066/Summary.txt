Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2005 Nissan Altima, 4-door sedan was traveling south in the left southbound lane of a three-lane, two-way road and approaching a four-leg intersection with the intention of turning left. Vehicle two (V2), a 2001 Ford Explorer Sport Trac, 4-door pickup truck was traveling west in the right westbound lane of four-lane, two way road and was approaching the same four-leg intersection as V1. It was dark, the streetlights were functioning, it was raining, and the bituminous road surface was wet. Both vehicles entered the intersection at the same time and the front of V2 struck the left side of V1 in a T-type configuration. Both vehicles were redirected toward the southwest corner where V2 came to rest across both eastbound lanes facing south. V1 came to rest off the southwest corner of the intersection facing south. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 26-year-old male driver of V2 sustained police-reported "0" injuries (not injured) and refused medical treatment. The 18-year-old female driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt but the steering-wheel air bag did not deploy. She sustained police-reported "A" injuries (incapacitating) and was transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital. She later transferred to a regional level-one trauma center. The 18-year-old female right-front passenger (non-case occupant) was also using the available three-point seat belt but the dash-mounted air bag did not deploy. She sustained police-reported "A" injuries (incapacitating) and was treated and released at a local hospital for superficial contusions and abrasions (ISS-1).
