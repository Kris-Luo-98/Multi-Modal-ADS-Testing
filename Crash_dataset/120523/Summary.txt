Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2004 Saturn Ion, 4-door sedan was traveling west in the westbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural road and was traversing a positive (uphill) grade. Vehicle two (V2), a 2005 Dodge Durango, 4-door utility vehicle was traveling east in the eastbound lane of the same road and was traversing a negative (downhill) grade. It was daylight, the weather was clear, and the bituminous road surface was dry. For an unknown reason, the driver of V1 drifted left across the center line, steered right to return to her lane of travel but ran off the right side of the road. The driver over-steered back to the left, re-entered the road in a counter clockwise yaw, crossed the center line and was struck on the right side by the front of V2. The driver of V2 recognized the impending danger and attempted to avoid the collision by braking and steering to the right but was unable to avoid striking V1. V1 came to rest on the south shoulder facing south and V2 came to rest partially on the south shoulder facing east-southeast. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The three occupants of V2 were transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital with unknown injuries. The 16-year-old female driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt but no air bags deployed in her seating position. She was transported via helicopter to a regional level-one trauma center where she expired from her injuries. The 14-year-old female right-front passenger of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt and the right-side curtain air bag deployed. She was also transported via helicopter to a regional level-one trauma center where she too expired from her injuries.
