Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2004 Honda Civic, 2-door coupe was traveling north in the northbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural road and was approaching a four-leg intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 2000 Pontiac Montana, minivan was traveling east in the eastbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural road and was approaching the same four-leg intersection as V1. It was daylight, the weather was clear, and the bituminous road surface was dry. V1 and V2 entered the intersection at the same time and both had intentions of passing straight through the intersection. Neither driver attempted any evasive actions and the front of V2 struck the left side of V1 in an L-type configuration. The impact caused V1 to rotate counter clockwise while departing the northeast corner of the intersection and strike a 40 cm diameter tree with the right-rear bumper and came to rest. The impact caused V2 to rotate counter clockwise and depart the northeast corner of the intersection and strike a telephone/cable access box with its right side. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The driver and three passengers of V2 were transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center with unknown injuries. The 41-year-old female driver of V1 (case occupant) was the sole occupant and was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center. She later transferred to another regional level-one trauma center.
