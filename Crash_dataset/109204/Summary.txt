Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2002 Chevrolet Trailblazer, 4-door utility vehicle was traveling east in the center left-turn lane of a five-lane, two-way roadway (two lanes westbound, center westbound left turn lane, two lanes eastbound) and was approaching a controlled four-leg intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 2002 Freightliner FLD-120, tractor pulling one trailer was traveling east in the right eastbound lane of the same roadway and was approaching the same intersection as V1. It was daylight, the sky was clear, and the bituminous road was dry. The driver of V1 began a left turn and crossed the path of V2. The driver of V2 was unable to avoid V1 and the front of V2 struck the right side of V1 in an L-type configuration. The impact caused V1 to rapidly rotate in a clockwise manner and the right-front of V1 sideslapped the right side of V2. V1 came to rest partially off the northwest corner, facing northwest. Both vehicles were reportedly towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 60-year-old female driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt (seat-integrated seat belt) but no airbags deployed. The 3-year-old female right-rear passenger was seated in a highback booster seat but the seat nor the child was restrained with the available three-point seat belt. She was completely ejected from the vehicle during the crash. Both occupants of the case vehicle were transported via ground ambulance to a local hospital and the case occupant (driver) was later transferred to a regional level-one trauma center.
