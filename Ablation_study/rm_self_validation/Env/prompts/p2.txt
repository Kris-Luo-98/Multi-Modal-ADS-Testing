Summary:
Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2002 Subaru Forester, 4-door utility vehicle was traveling west in the westbound lane of a two-lane, two-way roadway and was negotiating a right curve. Vehicle two (V2), a 2002 Buick Rendezvous, 4-door utility vehicle was traveling east in the eastbound lane of the same roadway and was negotiating a left curve. It was daylight, snowing, and the bituminous road was icy. The driver of V1 lost control on the icy road and began to rotate counterclockwise. V1 rotated approximately 90 degrees, crossed the centerline and entered the eastbound lane. The driver of V2 could not avoid V1 and the front of V2 struck the right side of V1 in a T-type configuration. Both vehicles were towed due to disabling vehicle damage. The 36-year-old male driver of V1 (case occupant) was using the available three-point seat belt but no airbags deployed in the driver's seating position. He was transported via ground ambulance to a regional level-one trauma center.

Analysis process:

----------
Step 1. Environment information extraction
From the Summary, we can first locate the sentence for describing weather and time: 'It was daylight, snowing, and the bituminous road was icy.'
The word for weather in the above text is 'snowing' and the word for time/light is 'daylight'.
Therefore, our answer for the Weather is Snowy, and the answer for the Time is Daytime

Please note that:
 (1)if the description of the environment includes 'dark' and 'street lights', the corresponding time should be Nighttime.
 (2)if the description of the environment includes 'dawn' and/or 'afternoon', the corresponding time should be Daytime.
 (3)if the description of the environment includes 'daylight clear', the corresponding time should be Daytime and weather should be Sunny.

Step 2. Validation
We bring the extracted answer back to the crash summary for validation:
Weather: Our answer Snowy corresponds to snowing in the crash summary.
Time: Our answer Daytime corresponds to daylight in the crash summary.

Validation passed!
Note: If the validation fails, please repeat from step 1 until the validation passes.
----------

Final Output:
{'Weather': 'Snowy', 'Time': 'Daytime', 'Validation': 'Passed'}
