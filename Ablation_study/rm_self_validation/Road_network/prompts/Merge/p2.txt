### Task
Extract road configuration details from the crash dataset. Answer each of the following questions:

1. **How many ways are there on the main road?** (integer)
2. **How many lanes are there on the main road?** (integer)
3. **How many lanes are there on the branch road?** (integer)
4. **What is the length of the main road?** (in meters)
5. **What is the width of a single lane?** (in meters)

#### Reference Information
For your calculations, you may use the following reference values:
- **Car**: Length = 5 meters, Width = 2 meters
- **Truck**: Length = 20 meters, Width = 2.5 meters

### Output Format
Provide your results in this format:
{ 'No_ways_main_road': <number of ways on the main road>, 'No_lanes_main_road': <number of lanes on the main road>, 'No_lanes_branch_road': <number of lanes on the branch road>, 'Length_main': <length of the main road>, 'Width': <width of a single lane>}
