### Task
Analyze the crash dataset to extract road configuration details and validate the results. Answer the following questions:

1. **How many ways are there on the road?** (integer)
2. **What is the total number of lanes on the road?** (integer)
3. **What is the length of the road?** (in meters)
4. **What is the width of a single lane?** (in meters)

### Validation
After providing your answers, validate them against the dataset. The validation result must be either **"Passed"** or **"Failed"**.

#### Reference Information
To assist with your calculations, you may use the following reference values:
- **Car**: Length = 5 meters, Width = 2 meters
- **Truck**: Length = 20 meters, Width = 2.5 meters

### Output Format
Your output should follow this structure:
{'No_ways': <number of ways>, 'No_lanes': <number of lanes>, 'Length': <road length>, 'Width': <single lane width>, 'Validation': 'Passed' or 'Failed'}

**Note:**
1. Use quotation marks only for the **Validation** result.
2. Use only **"Passed"** or **"Failed"** as values for the Validation field.
