### Task
Extract road configuration details from the crash dataset. Please answer the following questions:

1. **How many ways are there on the main road?** (integer)
2. **How many lanes are there on the main road?** (integer)
3. **How many ways are there on the branch road?** (integer)
4. **How many lanes are there on the branch road?** (integer)
5. **What is the length of the main road?** (in meters)
6. **What is the length of the branch road?** (in meters)
7. **What is the width of a single lane?** (in meters)

#### Reference Information
You may use the following reference values for your calculations:
- **Car**: Length = 5 meters, Width = 2 meters
- **Truck**: Length = 20 meters, Width = 2.5 meters

### Output Format
Provide your results in this format:
{ 'No_ways_main_road': <number of ways on the main road>, 'No_lanes_main_road': <number of lanes on the main road>, 'No_ways_branch_road': <number of ways on the branch road>, 'No_lanes_branch_road': <number of lanes on the branch road>, 'Length_main': <length of the main road>, 'Length_branch': <length of the branch road>, 'Width': <width of a single lane>}
