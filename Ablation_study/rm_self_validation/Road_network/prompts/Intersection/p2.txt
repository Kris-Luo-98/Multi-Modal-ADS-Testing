Extract road configuration details from the crash dataset. Answer each of the following questions:

1. **How many ways are there at most for roads bordering the intersection?** (integer)
2. **How many lanes are there at most for roads bordering the intersection?** (integer)
3. **What is the longest distance from one end of the intersection to the other?** (in meters)
4. **What is the width of a single lane?** (in meters)

#### Reference Information
For your calculations, you may use the following reference values:
- **Car**: Length = 5 meters, Width = 2 meters
- **Truck**: Length = 20 meters, Width = 2.5 meters

### Output Format
Present your output in this format:
{ 'No_ways': <number of ways>, 'No_lanes': <number of lanes>, 'Length': <longest distance at the intersection>, 'Width': <width of a single lane>}
