### Analysis Process

#### Step 1 - Extract the Number of Ways and Lanes
1. **Identify Key Descriptors in the Crash Summary**:
   - Example sentence: "Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 1998 Mercury Mountaineer, 4-door utility vehicle was traveling east in the eastbound lane of a two-lane, two-way rural roadway and was negotiating a slight curve to the left. Vehicle two (V2), a 2002 Ford F150, 4-door extended cab pickup truck was traveling west in the westbound lane of the same road but was negotiating a slight curve to the right."
2. **Extract Details**:
   - "Two-way" indicates the **number of ways** (answer: 2).
   - "Two-lane" indicates the **number of lanes** (answer: 2).

#### Step 2 - Estimate the Road Length and Lane Width from the Sketch
1. **Road Length**:
   - Define the length as the straight-line distance between the two ends of the curve.
   - From the sketch, estimate that this distance equals about 10 car lengths.
   - Calculation: \(5 \, \text{meters} \times 10 = 50 \, \text{meters}\).
2. **Lane Width**:
   - The car (marked "V1") occupies the middle of a lane, with half its width visible on each side.
   - Calculation: \(2 + \frac{2}{2} + \frac{2}{2} = 4 \, \text{meters}\).

Since all values align with the data, the validation is **Passed**.

### Final Output
Format your output as follows:
{'No_ways': 2, 'No_lanes': 2, 'Length': 50, 'Width': 4}
