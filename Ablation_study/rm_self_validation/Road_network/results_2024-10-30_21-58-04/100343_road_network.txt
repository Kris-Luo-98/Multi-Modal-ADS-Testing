### Analysis Process

#### Step 1 - Extract the Number of Ways and Lanes
1. **Read the crash summary** to identify the number of ways and lanes:
   - Example sentence: "Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2000 Chevrolet Malibu, 4-door sedan was traveling north in the right northbound lane of a limited access, four-lane, divided freeway (two lanes northbound, open median, two lanes southbound)."
2. **Identify Key Descriptors**:
   - "Divided freeway" with "two lanes northbound" and "two lanes southbound" describes the **number of ways** (answer: 2).
   - "Four-lane" describes the **total number of lanes** (answer: 4).

#### Step 2 - Estimate Road Length and Lane Width from the Sketch
1. **Road Length**:
   - The sketch shows a straight road with vehicles V1 and V2.
   - Measure the road's length using the truck (V2) as a reference (truck length = 20 meters).
   - The road appears to be approximately 6 truck lengths long.
   - Calculation: \(20 \, \text{meters} \times 6 = 120 \, \text{meters}\).
   
2. **Lane Width**:
   - The truck (V2) occupies the left lane, and its width is 2.5 meters.
   - Estimate lane width as the truck’s width plus some space on each side.
   - Calculation: \(2.5 + \frac{2.5}{2} + \frac{2.5}{2} = 5 \, \text{meters}\).

#### Step 3 - Validation
Verify the extracted values with the dataset:
- **No_ways** = 2: Matches the "divided freeway" description in the summary.
- **No_lanes** = 4: Matches the "four-lane" description in the summary.
- **Length** = 120 meters: Consistent with 6 truck lengths, as observed in the sketch.
- **Width** = 5 meters: Consistent with the truck’s width and spacing within the lane.

Since all values align with the data, the validation is **Passed**.

### Final Output
```python
{'No_ways': 2, 'No_lanes': 4, 'Length': 120, 'Width': 5, 'Validation': 'Passed'}
```
