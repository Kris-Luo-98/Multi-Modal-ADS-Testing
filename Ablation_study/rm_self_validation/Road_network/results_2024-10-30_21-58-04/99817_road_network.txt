### Step 1 - Extract the Number of Ways and Lanes

1. **Identify Key Descriptors in the Crash Summary**:
   - Example sentence: "Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 2002 Subaru Forester, 4-door utility vehicle was traveling west in the westbound lane of a two-lane, two-way roadway and was negotiating a right curve."
   - "Vehicle two (V2), a 2002 Buick Rendezvous, 4-door utility vehicle was traveling east in the eastbound lane of the same roadway and was negotiating a left curve."

2. **Extract Details**:
   - "Two-way" indicates the **number of ways** (answer: 2).
   - "Two-lane" indicates the **number of lanes** (answer: 2).

### Step 2 - Estimate the Road Length and Lane Width from the Sketch

1. **Road Length**:
   - From the sketch, estimate the road length by counting the number of car lengths.
   - The sketch shows approximately 8 car lengths.
   - Calculation: \(5 \, \text{meters} \times 8 = 40 \, \text{meters}\).

2. **Lane Width**:
   - The car (marked "V1") occupies the middle of a lane, with some space visible on each side.
   - The width of a car is 2 meters, and the lane appears to be slightly wider than the car.
   - Estimate the lane width to be approximately 3.5 meters.

### Step 3 - Validation

Verify the extracted values with the dataset:
- **No_ways** = 2: Matches the description of "two-way roadway" in the summary.
- **No_lanes** = 2: Matches the description of "two-lane" in the summary.
- **Length** = 40 meters: Consistent with 8 car lengths, as observed in the sketch.
- **Width** = 3.5 meters: Consistent with the carâ€™s width and spacing within the lane.

Since all values align with the data, the validation is **Passed**.

### Final Output
{'No_ways': 2, 'No_lanes': 2, 'Length': 40, 'Width': 3.5, 'Validation': 'Passed'}
