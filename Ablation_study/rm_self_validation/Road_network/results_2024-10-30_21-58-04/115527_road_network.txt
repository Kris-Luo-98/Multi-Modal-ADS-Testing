### Step 1 - Extract the Number of Ways and Lanes from Crash Summary

1. **Identify Road Details for V1 and V2**:
   - From the summary:
     > "Vehicle one (V1 - case vehicle), a 1998 Buick Century, 4-door sedan was traveling north in the left northbound lane of a five-lane, two-way urban road and was approaching a 4-leg intersection. Vehicle two (V2), a 1998 Pontiac Transport was traveling west in the left westbound lane of the intersecting five-lane road and was approaching the same intersection."

2. **Extract Key Information**:
   - V1 is on a **five-lane, two-way urban road**, so:
     - **number_of_ways_v1 = 2**
     - **number_of_lanes_v1 = 5**
   - V2 is on a **five-lane road**, so:
     - **number_of_ways_v2 = 2**
     - **number_of_lanes_v2 = 5**

3. **Determine Answers for Questions 1 and 2**:
   - For **question 1** (ways): Take the maximum value between `number_of_ways_v1` and `number_of_ways_v2` → **No_ways = 2**
   - For **question 2** (lanes): Take the maximum value between `number_of_lanes_v1` and `number_of_lanes_v2` → **No_lanes = 5**

### Step 2 - Approximate the Longest Distance Across the Intersection

1. **Analyze the Intersection in the Sketch**:
   - The intersection is a 4-leg intersection with both horizontal and vertical roads having five lanes each.

2. **Calculate Horizontal Road Length**:
   - V2 is on the horizontal road; knowing the car length is 5 meters, the horizontal road is about 9 car lengths.
   - Calculation: `5 x 9 = 45` meters

3. **Calculate Longitudinal Road Length**:
   - V1 is on the vertical road; knowing the car length is 5 meters, the longitudinal road is about 8 car lengths.
   - Calculation: `5 x 8 = 40` meters

4. **Determine Answer for Question 3**:
   - Take the maximum length between the horizontal and longitudinal roads → **Length = 45** meters

### Step 3 - Estimate Lane Width

1. **Determine Lane Width**:
   - Given that this is a five-lane, two-way urban road, the typical lane width is **3.5 meters**.

### Step 4 - Validation

Our answers are: `{'No_ways': 2, 'No_lanes': 5, 'Length': 45, 'Width': 3.5}`

Validation:
1. **No_ways**: Matches the summary’s description of "two-way urban road" and "two-way road."
2. **No_lanes**: Matches the summary’s description of "five-lane."
3. **Length**: 45 meters, consistent with 9 car lengths in the sketch (5 meters per car).
4. **Width**: 3.5 meters, consistent with typical lane width for urban roads.

Since all values align with the dataset, the validation is **Passed**.

### Final Output
```python
{'No_ways': 2, 'No_lanes': 5, 'Length': 45, 'Width': 3.5, 'Validation': 'Passed'}
```
