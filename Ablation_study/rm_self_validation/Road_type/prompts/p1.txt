I have a multi-modality dataset on car crashes, where each crash includes a sketch (graphical) and a summary (text).

In the crash sketches:
- Road networks, vehicles, trajectories, and crash details are depicted. Vehicles are labeled as V1, V2, etc., typically in red or blue rectangular blocks. **Ignore these vehicles** when analyzing road networks.

In the crash summaries:
- Each summary describes the road network, traffic participants, trajectories, and environmental details.

### Your Tasks:
1. **Extract the Road Network** from the crash summary. Select one of these five values:
   - **Intersection**, **T-intersection**, **Straight**, **Curve**, **Merge**.

2. **Validate** your road type answer against the sketch. If the validation fails, adjust until it passes.

### Important Details:
- **Intersection**: Formed by crossing roads, with four openings.
- **T-intersection**: Two roads meeting in a "T" shape, with three openings.
- **Merge**: Typically involves a straight and a curved road meeting together.

### Output Format:
Provide results in this structure, without quotation marks:
{'Road type': <road type>, 'Validation': <Pass/Fail>}

#### Example Outputs:
- `{'Road type': Intersection, 'Validation': Pass}`
- `{'Road type': Straight, 'Validation': Pass}`
- `{'Road type': Merge, 'Validation': Fail}`
