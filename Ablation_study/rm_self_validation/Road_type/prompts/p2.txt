### Analysis Process

#### Step 1 - Extract the Road Type
1. **Read the crash summary** to identify road features:
   - Example: "V1 was traveling on a curved, two-lane, two-way road, and V2 was also traveling on this curved road."
2. **Determine the road type** based on the description. For example:
   - If the summary describes a "curved road" with no intersections, classify the road as **Curve**.

### Output
Provide the result in this format, without quotation marks:
{'Road type': Curve}
